13:48  gavino| why?
13:48  tlonim| lol
13:48  Burning_Aces| need it to register for a site

13:48  Burning_Aces| velcroshooz: :(
13:49  velcroshooz| id give you mine but hell i only know the last 5 digits, no one ever uses the prefix :p
13:49  papertigers| anyone know where I could get a nice server chassis for a lot of drives pretty cheap
13:49  Burning_Aces| velcroshooz: isnt it 5 digits - 4 digits?
13:50  velcroshooz| i thought it was 4 - 5 .. ie on all my mail i get 50701
13:50         -!- enderst_ is now known as enderst
13:50  velcroshooz| maybe it is a suffix, shrug
13:50  Burning_Aces| yeah thats the 5 digit part
13:50  Burning_Aces| "This is used for human verification during registration. It is only visible to you. It must be five digits, optionally followed by a dash and four digits."
13:51  Burning_Aces| wait
13:51  Burning_Aces| disregard that
13:51  Burning_Aces| it says optionally
13:52  hatten| yeah, so 50701 is enough then
13:52  madm1ke| hi, can somebody tell me how i can query my cd recorder for available speeds?
13:53  Burning_Aces| hatten: yeah
13:54  tlonim| madm1ke: it shud be in dmesg ...grep for sr0 or something similar

13:56  tlonim| gavino: bam! ur identity is lost :)
13:56  hatten| tlonim: you asked me about the frames
13:57  tlonim| hatten: yes..i was concerned only of the  frames rate..
13:57  hatten| tlonim: aha, you knew nothing more =p
13:57  tlonim| hatten: i am not sure of the geometry..
14:00  keenerd| hatten: I use "mplayer -vo fbdev -bpp 32 -geometry 50%:50%" for framebuffer video.
14:01  xenoterracide| what's the default CFLAGS for x86_64?
14:01  fogobogo| xenoterracide: cat /etc/makepkg.conf
14:02  xenoterracide| fogobogo I changed them
14:02  hatten| keenerd: bah, my aliases fucked it up earlier
14:02  xenoterracide| trying to fix something and wondering if that's the problem
14:02  xenoterracide| but I don't know what they were
14:02  fogobogo| sorry. no x64 here
14:02  tasker| see if you have a /etc/makepkg.conf.pacnew
14:02  velcroshooz| thats why you backed up makepkg.conf first right? ;)
14:03  hatten| keenerd: but the videos that are normally fullscreen is far from fullscreen in fb
14:03  fogobogo| hatten: -fs i think
14:03  velcroshooz| xenoterracide, CFLAGS="-march=athlon64 -O2 -pipe" is mine
14:03  xenoterracide| lol I do have a pacnew. I should checked that first... sorry.
14:04  xenoterracide| velcroshooz right like mine you've optimized for processor I have =core2
14:04  keenerd| hatten: Ah.  Resizing video in fb is generally a losing proposition.
14:04  hatten| fogobogo: that only blackens out the surrounding space
14:04  hatten| keenerd: eh k
14:04  xenoterracide| but this build is breaking and I want to make sure that's not why
14:04  xenoterracide| 'cause it works when I do it by hand
14:04  hatten| keenerd: but aren't they already down-resized?
14:04  velcroshooz| xenoterracide, havent touched my flags, thats what arch installed mine as - so there may not be one default, depending on intel/amd
14:05  fogobogo| hatten: -xy px:px?
14:05  fogobogo| err
14:05  keenerd| hatten: By default, mplayer plays it at normal res.
14:05  fogobogo| -xy px
14:05  xenoterracide| CFLAGS="-march=x86-64 -mtune=generic -O2 -pipe"
14:05  keenerd| hatten: -fs -zoom -sws 4 -xy 2 will double the size
14:05  xenoterracide| pacnew is that
14:05  xenoterracide| so I'm reverting to that to see if it's why
14:06  WebLOCH| allo allo, I seem to have a problem, I've had vmplayer installed for about 4 days, with ubuntu installed as an image, whenever I start it now (I haven't rebooted and haven't upgraded since) I get a message as follows ; "Could not connect Ethernet0 to virtual network /dev/vmnet8"  does anyone know why this might have arisen or how to fix it?
14:06  keenerd| hatten: I don't think there is a one-size-fits-all fullscreen option for FB.
14:06  tlonim| hatten: what framebuffer driver u are using btw ? uvesafb ?
14:06  hatten| keenerd: that made the video lag after the sound
14:06  hatten| tlonim: no clue, I set it in grub
14:07  hatten| whoa
14:07  hatten| that was meant to keenerd
14:07  tlonim| default is uvesafb i guess..
14:07  hatten| keenerd: I'm normally an X junkie
14:07  hatten| keenerd: although, I have no clue if this gfx card would be able to play the video at normal speed in X
14:08  hatten| keenerd: this is just one I popped in when my normal broke
14:08  keenerd| hatten: I don't use it much either.
14:09         * hatten wanders off to the toilet
14:10  fogobogo| WebLOCH: seems the vm cant hook up your eth0 to its virtual counterpart. since its ubuntu you simply delete the image and be happy. else you might disable network support for the vm
14:11  aky| anyone got "Go upgrade!" pointing to http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/ instead of the clip on youtube lately? i use latest cromium(5.0.342.9-1) and flashplugin(10.0.45.2-1)
14:11  phrik| Title: Adobe - Adobe Flash Player (at get.adobe.com)
14:13  retybok| is there a good way to monitor network usage per process? something like top but which would show network usage instead of cpu...
14:13         * hatten be back
14:13  d_garbage| WebLOCH, could try virtualbox
14:13  d_garbage| WebLOCH, also, i was it working before?
14:14  fonseg| how a .desktop file just contain the name of icon for the program, not the full path, i.e "/usr/share/applications/inkscape.desktop" has "Icon=inkscape" not "Icon=/usr/share/pixmap/inkscape.png" ?
14:14  WebLOCH| haha, you people amaze me
14:14  papertigers| i like bwm-ng for network usage
14:14  papertigers| but it doesnt show you per process
14:14  WebLOCH| ubuntu is the vm image for a reason, it needs network access, and yes it was previously working, the virtualbox image works fine, I need both vbox and vm* images
14:14  retybok| papertigers: I use it as well, but in the problem I'm having now it doesn't help
14:14  d_garbage| WebLOCH, also try #vmware maybe?
14:14  sec0nd| checking. I started hal and alsa and drivers are installed is there anything else I need to start before i run startx?
14:15  retybok| we have a problem with a server and I'd like to identify the culprit
14:15  retybok| there are tons of processes running on that server
14:15  hatten| KILLALL!
14:15  papertigers| retybok: so you are looking for the process using up the network
14:16  WebLOCH| d_garbage, will do cheers
14:16  retybok| papertigers: exactly
14:16  d_garbage| WebLOCH, you know i think you can access vmware images with virtualbox too
14:18  papertigers| retybok: i was just googling and I cant find anything either
14:20  retybok| :-/
14:20  retybok| I'm sure there must be a way
14:20  papertigers| retybok: does netstat help at all
14:20  pespin| hi, I'm following the wiki concerning addition of spellcheckers in go-openoffice, but it seems it's not working at all
14:21  pespin| I add the dictionary using the extension manager, but i don't get a menu for that language in the spellcheck menu
14:21  papertigers| retybok: what exactly is the issue
14:22         -!- pespin is now known as pespin_
14:22  WebLOCH| okay anyone else here using vmplayer/vmware?
14:22         -!- pespin_ is now known as pespin-
14:22         -!- pespin- is now known as pespin
14:23  d_garbage| WebLOCH, still getting  "Could not connect Ethernet0 to virtual network /dev/vmnet8" ?
14:23  retybok| papertigers: I've done netstat, but there are too many connections
14:23  WebLOCH| d_garbage, yup, had to start vmmon vmci and vmnet manually, but alas no /dev/vmnet8
14:23  retybok| papertigers: the network is slow, and from bwm-ng I can see there is an unusual amount of traffic going on
14:24  retybok| But I don't know what exactly is going on
14:24  d_garbage| WebLOCH, you said you haven't updated, may you should?
14:24  d_garbage| maybe
14:24  WebLOCH| d_garbage, thats just likely to break a whole slew of things that id ont have time to fix today unfortunately, or I'd give it a shot
14:25  d_garbage| aha ok, fair enough
14:25  d_garbage| i know what you mean :))
14:27  d_garbage| WebLOCH, btw did you try #vmware? Admittadly  if its anything like #vbox they are mostly windows  users, but you never know.
14:27  retybok| ok, I've found iftop which is ok
14:27  retybok| still doesn't do by process though
14:27  d_garbage| er, #vmware ?
14:30  WebLOCH| d_garbage, yeah im in there too havent had a respons yet, im just gonna start symlinking shit till my box drops
14:30  WebLOCH| d_garbage, then i get to be twice as annoyed and just go play video games
14:30  d_garbage| :)
14:31  hatten| wow, pretty dead in here
14:32  d_garbage| no-one has any problems :)
14:32  hatten| I'm eating egg and makaroni btw
14:32  velcroshooz| grub is fighting me  tooth and nail in this chroot, gr. does NOT want to install correctly.
14:32  hatten| I have shitloads of problems
14:32  hatten| but I don't feel for doing them now
14:33         * hatten still doesn't have X
14:33  WebLOCH| d_garbage, what do you mean by nobody has problems?
14:33  WebLOCH| oh i see ignore me
14:33  hatten| lol?
14:33  d_garbage| i meant generaly , of course
14:33  d_garbage| :)
14:34  fogobogo| WebLOCH: qemu ftw!
14:34  WebLOCH| riiight so dumb question /dev/ is just a dir right?
14:34  velcroshooz| not very many use vmware .. you'd have alot more help with vbox ;)
14:34  WebLOCH| fogobogo, you ham-fisted monkey, listen with your eyes damnit.
14:34  d_garbage| besides its Spring in the (northern) Northern Hemisphere, and even geeks minds turn to other things at this time
14:34  WebLOCH| haha guys I want to support both, the image needs to be as widely available as possible
14:35  d_garbage| re-install? :)
14:35  d_garbage| re-boot? haha
14:35  hatten| d_garbage: other things? like RAID?
14:35  WebLOCH| d_garbage, yeah might end up doing that, what a farce, i cant wait till its done and i can gvie up on it
14:35  d_garbage| hatten, :)
14:36  hatten| is it "hard" (as in lots of work) to get RAID going?
14:36  d_garbage| never used it
14:36  WebLOCH| #vmware is slack
14:36  hatten| software
14:37  hatten| I have three 40GB disks
14:37  hatten| and it would be cool to try it
14:37  WebLOCH| hatten it's probably not
14:37  d_garbage| i think it can have its problems, but i don't think its normally that hard to do
14:37  hatten| j
14:37  hatten| k
14:37  d_garbage| i have heard a lot of negative comments about software RAID though, i must say
14:38  d_garbage| as in, "Don't"
14:38  hatten| such as?
14:38  hatten| aha
14:38  velcroshooz| i would just use LVM on a setup like that, unless you had a specific need for raid
14:38  WebLOCH| hatten, any reason?
14:38  hatten| nah
14:38  WebLOCH| bah sorry
14:38  hatten| only for speed
14:38  WebLOCH| d_garbage, any reasons why not to?
14:39  hatten| I like the "security" stuff with it
14:39  d_garbage| WebLOCH, dunno, just have heard a lot of negative comments, that i didn't really pay much attention too - since i don't need it.
14:39  hatten| although I have a 2TB external so I have space for pretty much
14:40  hatten| although with LVM and several disks, what happens if one disk fails?
14:40  hatten| you lose everything?
14:40  WebLOCH| d_garbage, im looking to use software raid in a month or two for my NAS
14:40  markatto| hatten: in theory you only lose what was on that disk
14:40  hatten| I like that word, in theory
14:40  markatto| hatten: in practice it is not easy to get at the stuff that was on other disks
14:41  hatten| haha
14:41  hatten| so basically you're lost if you didn't backup properly
14:41  markatto| hatten: you're certainly not in a desirable situation
14:41  hatten| hah
14:41         -!- Asen-Ger is now known as Buccaneer
14:41  hatten| gahh, stupid linux, too much choice!
14:42  velcroshooz| true backups will beat out raid anyday, if your worried about losing data there are alot better solutions.
14:42  WebLOCH| haha
14:42  WebLOCH| raid5 bbaaaaby
14:42  hatten| yes of course
14:42  hatten| WebLOCH: you're on raid right now?
14:43  WebLOCH| hatten, no, ill be using 4 drives in software raid5 on a host in a month or so for NAS
14:44  hatten| aha
14:44  hatten| NAS stands for?
14:44         * hatten is lazy right now
14:44  velcroshooz| network attached storage
14:44  WebLOCH| Network Attached Storage
14:44  hatten| aha
14:44  hatten| size of drives?
14:45  WebLOCH| 1.5tb or 2tb
14:45  hatten| wow, that'll get pretty big
14:45  FSB_1| Nätverksansluten lagring
14:45  FSB_1| :O
14:45  hatten| lalz
14:45  WebLOCH| hatten, i've had the misfortune of losing three hdds in the last 5 years, its pissed me off more and more each time, so im building a fortress for my data
14:45  hatten| roflmao
14:46         * FSB_1 likes zfs for storage.
14:46  hatten| I've had one hdd failed
14:46  hatten| and I'm not entirely sure if it is failed even
14:46  fogobogo| hatten: NAS is basically a hdd with hooked up with an ethernet card and nothing else
14:46  hatten| and it's only on 2.52 GB :D
14:46  velcroshooz| o.O sounds like bad power supplies, ive never had an hdd die in my life ;p
14:46  WebLOCH| is there a way of listing installed modules that aren't loaded at the moment?
14:46  hatten| fogobogo: aha
14:46  td123| velcroshooz: me neither, but I usually replace them before they get a chance :P
14:46  WebLOCH| fogobogo, that depends really, mine will have failover
14:47  velcroshooz| td123, yeah, i spose that is true of me also - they get too small for me before i wear them out
14:47  hatten| lol
14:47  hatten| I still use 10GB hdd's
14:48  hatten| nothing is too small
14:48  velcroshooz| ive got twin 80s as OS drives .. otherwise i wont bother with less than 500 gigs
14:48  hatten| I think I have one that's in use atm that's around 5
14:48  fogobogo| hatten: using linux since long?
14:48  hatten| fogobogo: 1.5 years
14:48  WebLOCH| if i wasnt running vms i would agree with hatten
14:49  WebLOCH| but can anyone tell me how to list installed kernel modules that aren't loaded yet?
14:49  fogobogo| hatten: not bad. recently came to arch?
14:49  hatten| about a year i think
14:49  fogobogo| WebLOCH: lsmod should show all that are currently in use
14:49  Metal-Fox| hey, can anybody help me? I'm having the trouble  with the intel audio device from HP computers, bot nothing seems so solve it
14:49  fogobogo| WebLOCH: the other way around though... no idea
14:49  WebLOCH| fogobogo, cheers thats exactly what i didnt ask for
14:49  hatten| fogobogo: check my user at the forums for registration date
14:50         * hatten still doesn't have X
14:50  fogobogo| hatten: no. its ok. i will just believe you
14:50  hatten| haha
14:50  hatten| but I would like to know too
14:50  hatten| =p
14:50  xenoterracide| WebLOCH hmm I think they all have a certain extention and are all in one directory
14:51  fogobogo| WebLOCH: modprobe --list maybe?
14:52  WebLOCH| im about to be classified a troll on #vmware because they're all pretentious dicks
14:53  WebLOCH| ive been waiting for this moment since highschool
14:53  daredevilfury| lol
14:54  hatten| fogobogo: registered at arch forums 2009-02-23
14:54  fogobogo| hatten: its ok. really ;)
14:54  WebLOCH| and now that i feel im being classified, i want to live up to that classification
14:54  hatten| WebLOCH: start using vbox then
14:54  WebLOCH| man, noone is listening today
14:54  hatten| fogobogo: I know, but I wanted to find out, I found out, and though I would tell you =p
14:55  WebLOCH| hatten, the vbox image is fine and finished, i need a vmware one too, i need as much availability for this image as possible haha
14:55  hatten| nope
14:55  velcroshooz| why even support vmware. opensource! down with the man
14:55  hatten| lol
14:55  WebLOCH| velcroshooz, because charity  is more important than my preference
14:55  hatten| lets ddos #wmvare! vbox ftw!
14:55  daredevilfury| hatten: but that would preclude getting classified as a troll on #vmware. and that wouldn't be fun either would it?
14:55  velcroshooz| fair enough
14:55  whuffor| hmm. My sound is acting weird... internal soundcard stops working after having listened/watched something with mplayer. Get message /dev/dps resource busy.
14:56  whuffor| It starts working again after having done: alsactl restore NVidia
14:56  daredevilfury| lol
14:56  WebLOCH| daredevilfury, you sound like a stalwart individual, i like it.
14:56  hatten| daredevilfury: hmm, that involved too many complicated words for tired me
14:56  daredevilfury| haha
14:57  WebLOCH| <||cw> uninstall player, delete /etc/vmware and reinstall player?  as far as I know, there simply is no network editor
14:57  WebLOCH| <WebLOCH> ||cw, the editor would just be a UI for something a man can do with vi, i just need to figure out what that is
14:57  hatten| so you said that it isn't fun to be a troll?
14:57  WebLOCH| hatten, nah, i said i could feel it happening
14:57  hatten| I meant daredevilfury
14:57  WebLOCH| oh
14:58  WebLOCH| s/devil/troll/ and he won't know the difference
14:59  daredevilfury| hatten: lol i'll have to get back to the channel later. gaming is getting fun lol
14:59  hatten| meh
14:59  hatten| evil devil
14:59  hatten| what're you playingL
14:59  hatten| ?
14:59  daredevilfury| hon
14:59  daredevilfury| (:
14:59  hatten| lulz
14:59  hatten| I got a demo for it
14:59  daredevilfury| lol
14:59  hatten| but my comp couldn't handle it
15:00  hatten| or rather, none of my comps could
15:00  daredevilfury| "demo"? i wasn't aware of a demo lol
15:00  velcroshooz| i cant even play it, i get ridiculed out of games because i have no clue what im doing. the tutorial kind of sucks
15:00  daredevilfury| haha
15:00  daredevilfury| true true
15:00  hatten| I mean beta
15:00  Tera| press button, receive bacon
15:00  velcroshooz| i wasnt in for closed beta, and all the peeps that were have to hate the influx of noobs when it went open beta, i dont blame them. but jeez how else do you learn.
15:00  daredevilfury| velcroshooz: try joining the "no stats" games for practice ;)
15:01  velcroshooz| daredevilfury, i will remember that, thanks
15:01  Hylas| velcroshooz, trust me, there were plenty of noobs before it went into open beta aswell.
15:01  daredevilfury| velcroshooz: haha yeah i understand that, but the noobs who are annoying are those that join "no noobs" games haha
15:01  velcroshooz| because id love to get into it, my style of game, and native linux support
15:01  Hylas| hon has some nice stats tracking too
15:02  daredevilfury| yeah, i came over from dota because of native linux support lolz
15:02  daredevilfury| kind of getting offtopic here haha
15:03  hatten| it's cool, nobody needs help
15:03  gyo| off topic?
15:03  gyo| KILL DASH NINE
15:03  fogobogo| hatten: arch is miserably stable
15:03  brummbaer| haha
15:03  velcroshooz| ive been playing torchlight in wine, if i could get into hon i could dump that as well as  wine, which i would love. anyways ..
15:03  hatten| fogobogo: haha
15:04  WebLOCH| isnt steam releasing its cross platform gaming engine whassit soon?
15:04  brummbaer| aye. opengl ftw
15:04  hatten| fogobogo: too bad hardware isn't
15:04  daredevilfury| WebLOCH: isn't that only for mac os?
15:04  markatto| WebLOCH: you mean steam for OSX and opengl-based source engine?
15:04  markatto| sadly no linux love yet
15:04  daredevilfury| damn
15:04  daredevilfury| got excited there for a moment
15:05  WebLOCH| ahh, i was told the other day by a mac user, so i should have figured they were full of shit
15:05  markatto| although once they have an OSX port, how much more work can a linux port be?
15:05  hatten| like, shitloads?
15:05  daredevilfury| markatto: lolz i'm just shooting in the dark here, but if they use mac services like coreAudio etc, i'd say a lot
15:06  markatto| daredevilfury: i would expect them to use sdl
15:06  WebLOCH| markatto, definitely, at work i spent the last two days getting odbc connections to work under osx
15:06  WebLOCH| when they apparently wwork fine under *nix
15:06  hatten| daredevilfury: what game are you playing? shooting in the dark sounds fun
15:06  hatten| ;0;0
15:06  daredevilfury| k my game starting lol
15:06  linfan| hi
15:06  hatten| gogo win
15:06  daredevilfury| hatten: lol! was just a figure of speech
15:06  hatten| for us
15:06  markatto| WebLOCH: well, the game engine already runs on linux, we know this because of the server version
15:06  fogobogo| daredevilfury: whats your game/
15:06  daredevilfury| haha
15:06  fogobogo| ?
15:06  daredevilfury| hon k gtg
15:06  hatten| daredevilfury: i know ;)
15:06  hatten| fogobogo: ?
15:07  markatto| so what's left? they've ported the rendering pipeline to opengl
15:07  fogobogo| hatten: the game daredevilfury made. wonder what it is
15:07  markatto| and what is source besides a game engine and rendering pipeline?
15:07  WebLOCH| markatto, theres a large difference between server and game engines
15:07         * hatten wants a steam port for ... WII!
15:07  velcroshooz| markatto, possibly the gui itself? dunno .. there would be some big diffs there between aqua and X win
15:07  linfan| I tried a new ipv6 client from AUR called gogoc and now it fails and I cannot log in to change it. I forgot how to access rc.conf to disable the daemon. I tried with Single in grub but it did not help.
15:08  hatten| velcroshooz: hell, let's go for framebuffer instead!
15:08  velcroshooz| hatten, you just say that because you dont have X running yet ;)
15:08  daevski_| !yay
15:08  phrik| Yay!
15:08  hatten| linfan: edit rc.conf with nano and remove the daemon from the daemon row
15:08  hatten| velcroshooz: stfu
15:08         -!- daevski_ is now known as daevski
15:08         -!- YPSY is now known as Ypsy
15:08  hatten| !stfu
15:08  phrik| http://stfu.se
15:09  linfan| hatten: the problem is i am not getting a prompt the bootup has frozen
15:09  hatten| linfan: liveCD?
15:09  velcroshooz| yup ..
15:09  linfan| ok, so that is the only way?
15:09  hatten| linfan: probably not
15:09  velcroshooz| linfan, livecd, chroot in, change your rc.conf
15:09  daevski| linfan, that's what I'd do next
15:09  linfan| you cannot do that from grub
15:09  hatten| linfan: but it's one
15:10  daevski| linfan, you boot the cd, and mount your drive 'mount /dev/sda1 /mnt' then 'nano /etc/rc.conf'
15:11  daevski| not from grub
15:11  linfan| so you cannot boot into microsoftian safe mode via grub - ok
15:11  fogobogo| no?
15:11  fogobogo| methinks you can
15:11  jelly12gen| yuo can
15:11  jelly12gen| *you
15:11  velcroshooz| linfan, well you said youve already tried booting grub into single user?
15:12  fogobogo| jelly12gen: o/
15:12  linfan| it still tries to load the failing daemon
15:12  jelly12gen| fogobogo: o/
15:12  fogobogo| :>
15:12  linfan| it is with capital letters Single isn't it?
15:13  velcroshooz| linfan, i think its just 'S' at the end of the line?
15:13  WebLOCH| foooking get in, ive solved the probleeeem!
15:13  linfan| no hyphen?
15:13  velcroshooz| dunno, im not a big grub ninja, i know chrooting better and prefer to just boot off a stick to fix
15:14  hatten| WATCH OUT! A FUCKINF GRUB NINJA!
15:14  linfan| i will retry with palin capital S
15:14  velcroshooz| jonnor knows what it is, too bad he isnt here. he helped the last person who had an issue like this

15:19  archman| hello
15:19  hatten| is it good that I write "not completely broken" on my hardware?
15:19  archman| where can i see the changelogs on the updated packages? except the pacman -Qc ?
15:19  jelly12gen| archman: google
15:19  hatten| /var/log/pacman.log ?
15:20  archman| jelly12gen, ok
15:20  sledgehammer| archman, upstream changelog for most things - arch svn repo for arch things
15:20  jelly12gen| !bbs changelog pacman packages
15:20  phrik| jelly12gen: Arch Linux Forums / Package changes: <http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=86030>
15:22  hatten| wow, -Qc spits out a lot
15:22  sledgehammer| hatten, yeah... but most of it says "no changelog available" :)
15:23  jelly12gen| yup
15:23  jelly12gen| cause not all packages provide it ;)
15:23  hatten| sledgehammer: there's still many screens with text
15:24         * hatten is off to bed, bye everybody

15:29  archman| i don't really understand this "upstream changelog"
15:29  jelly12gen| you missed it all

15:29  archman| yeah :D
15:29  fogobogo| archman: /var/log/pacman.log
15:30  DarthPuff| what package do i need for glxgears?
15:30  archman| fogobogo, not that :) tnx anyway
15:30  mikeshultz| Anyone know of an alternative driver to openchrome?
15:30  fogobogo| !give DarthPuff pkgfile
15:30  phrik| DarthPuff: A tool to find out what package owns a file. Now available in community/pkgtools! http://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/pkgtools/
15:30  DarthPuff| fogobogo: oohhhhhh :D
15:30  fogobogo| mikeshultz: via has a prop one no?
15:30  fogobogo| unichrome or so
15:30  velcroshooz| archman, whats not to understand? you need to go to the site of the app and check thier changelog, as arch does little as possible to modify anything
15:31  archman| aaah
15:31  archman| yes yes, just realized :D
15:31  archman| Qi and then i see the site, and go check there
15:31  mikeshultz| fogobogo: I'll take a look.  Thanks.
15:35  DarthPuff| hrmmmmm 172fps! this won't do!

15:40  archman| hi
15:40  The_ManU_212| someone knwos a beautiful matrix screensaver i can use with archlinux, running udner dke?
15:40  fogobogo| The_ManU_212: liverpool rocks
15:40  The_ManU_212| *kde
15:40         * fogobogo runs
15:41  fogobogo| The_ManU_212: cmatrix
15:41  jelly12gen| riverpool sucks
15:41  The_ManU_212| fogobogo: but cmatrix is only for tty is earch one for X11
15:41  fogobogo| FreshPrince: hows bel-air?
15:41  FreshPrince| well
15:42  FreshPrince| its fine i quess
15:42  FreshPrince| :)
15:42  fogobogo| The_ManU_212: doesnt xscreensaver have one?
15:42  fogobogo| The_ManU_212: else have a look at that eletric sheep thing. thats even more matrixy
15:42  velcroshooz| gnome screensaver does for sure, opengl one, cant say ive ever seen one in kde though
15:43  tlonim| The_ManU_212: there is one u can run in terminal.... it is called cmatrix..
15:45  The_ManU_212| fogobogo: I#m afraid about this sheep thing eprhaps our machines are used for something we dont want? oO
15:45  fogobogo| The_ManU_212: http://community.electricsheep.org/ that one?
15:45  phrik| Title: about | electric sheep (at community.electricsheep.org)
15:45  The_ManU_212| tlonim: yeah i know thx i search one for X11 is there perhaps a package for "The Matrix" it seems to be an older one but for me cool enough
15:46  fogobogo| no idea. probably not. in fact its quite popular for a screensaver afaik
15:46  The_ManU_212| fogobogo: yeah i read bout it but perhaps we dunno what is done with our machine while it is running?
15:46  The_ManU_212| and you need a account
15:46  The_ManU_212| to log in :/
15:47  fogobogo| The_ManU_212: well, its some kind of collaborative artwork or so
15:48  fogobogo| more matrix than you can handle. and the red lady eventually shows up for real
15:48  DarthPuff| fogobogo: is it possible to unmount my root directory... so that i can mkfs.jfs -J device=/dev/sdb1 /dev/sda3
15:49  fogobogo| DarthPuff: live cd
15:49  t0rc| fogobogo: where is this red lady.
15:49  t0rc| :P
15:49  DarthPuff| fogobogo: what if the devs are not named the same?
15:49  fogobogo| t0rc: comes up when you see the cat twice and follow the white rabbit
15:49  tlonim| fogobogo: is red lady the one from The Ring ? crawling out of screen to kill :P
15:50  t0rc| liesss
15:50  sudokode| anyone know the name of that wireless kvm thing (keyboard/video/mouse switch)
15:50  sudokode| where like you share your input/display wirelessly...
15:50  fogobogo| tlonim: nah, the other red lady. not the mythbuster one but the hot one that kills you with agent smiths
15:51  sudokode| o.O
15:51  fogobogo| sudokode: its a volcanic cloud darkening the world
15:51  velcroshooz| sudokode, synergy? oh video too n/m
15:51  sudokode| velcroshooz, yes, thank you
15:52  velcroshooz| oh that was it ;) i couldnt go without synergy
15:52  sudokode| well, maybe it didn't include video, that'd be nice, but probably just as easy with X
15:52  sudokode| I was told about that when mentioning I need a kvm switch, which is like... just as it sounds
15:52  sudokode| a lot easier, but I don't have one >.<
15:53  velcroshooz| synergy is dead simple, i use it for controlling my laptop from the desktop .. just move my mouse offscreen right on desktop and it shows up on the lappy ;)
15:53  sudokode| cool
15:54  sudokode| except.. I only have one monitor.. and I was thinking about throwing together some old hardware to make a little server type thing
15:54  velcroshooz| yeah i dont know about using it like that. something like freenx might be better for a headless setup
15:54  sudokode| hm...
15:54  velcroshooz| (assuming you want a full desktop)
15:55  Aardwolf| Hi, I have C++ code of a program. It has no makefile and no configure script, but can be compiled with g++. It has a few .png files that the executable needs to load at startup, that need to be installed together with the program. How can I turn this into a PKGBUILD?
15:55  sudokode| well, yeah, I wouldn't need a full desktop, that's true
15:55  velcroshooz| well you could probably just forward X with ssh for specific apps
15:55  fogobogo| Aardwolf: hmmmm
15:55  sudokode| I would need to set it up, and I only have two usb 10mb/s wireless adapters
15:56  sudokode| which, I picked up for free, though it might not be too hard to use them together, I never have bought a router
15:56  sudokode| maybe just install with the monitor attached to it, set up the network, then ssh in from now on
15:56  fogobogo| Aardwolf: better write a makefile first. everything else is dropping the resources into the right directories. check man install
15:56  velcroshooz| sudokode, thats the route id take
15:56  sudokode| should prolly just buy another nic, but I'm not even sure I'll use it full time
15:57  sudokode| or a router
15:57  fogobogo| Aardwolf: actually the easiest way would be to learn about makefiles. serves you well in the future too
15:57  Aardwolf| fogobogo, I'm pretty new at this, I read a lot of things about makefiles and configure scripts the last days, but haven't quite got a global picture yet. Is it the makefile that's also responsible for installing data files (such as those png's)?
15:58  sudokode| a makefile installs everything.. with "make install"
15:58  fogobogo| Aardwolf: makefile is basically a glorified bash script. you set up some variable e.g. what compiler to use and make will run it
15:59  sudokode| yeah,
15:59  fogobogo| Aardwolf: you can also determine where files have to belong to etc.
15:59  sudokode| except it's meant to be dynamic, since it reads from the configure file
15:59  fogobogo| Aardwolf: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/287259/minimum-c-make-file-for-linux
15:59  phrik| Title: minimum c++ make file for linux - Stack Overflow (at stackoverflow.com)
16:00  sudokode| which can also be dynamic, if you use autogen, but not much stuff does
16:00  Aardwolf| ok, thanks, more stuff to read :)
16:00  sudokode| lol, sorry
16:00  fogobogo| Aardwolf: dont worry about the configure stuff at first. makefile is the most important.
16:01  Aardwolf| ok, that's quite good
16:01  kkuno| hi
16:01  sudokode| yeah, the configure stuff is just for dependencies
16:01  fogobogo| Aardwolf: and you better didnt hardcode the paths to your pngs ;)
16:01  kkuno| someone with kde4 can past a picture of mouse configuration?
16:01  sudokode| and since most people use a package manager and/or binary file instead of compiling stuff anyway
16:01  kkuno| for multitouch/synaptics support
16:01  karabaja4| what does exclamation mark stand for inside a patch file?
16:02  Aardwolf| well, it works with the exact same g++ command on ubuntu and archlinux, I suppose that means it'll also work on any other modern distro
16:02  Aardwolf| fogobogo, the path is hardcoded now but I turned it into a #define today
16:02  sudokode| yeah, you should include support for the png's in the working directory, then in /usr/share or /usr/local/share, or wherever you can really install this thing
16:02  fogobogo| Aardwolf: yeah. you would want your pngs in /usr/share/myapp/images/ or so.
16:02  sudokode| it's really up to the user, so you have to make it as dynamic as possible to a sane degree
16:03  Aardwolf| sudokode, usr/local/share is a pretty empty directory in my arch, while usr/share has lots in it. What's the difference?
16:03  fogobogo| Aardwolf: check man hier
16:03  fogobogo| that explains it
16:04  sudokode| /usr/local is called the sandbox, and it's kinda like /opt, except it's for compiled/installed stuff that is sort of in a development level or a "local" testing level
16:04  sudokode| you don't even really have to include support to install it to /usr/local, but some people still use it for testing purposes
16:05  sudokode| like I said, think of a /usr that you can play around with, that is... basically empty
16:05  sudokode| that's /usr/local
16:05  sudokode| "sandbox"
16:12  karabaja4| what does ! stand for inside a patch file? like +++, - - - -, and !!!!
16:13  Serpardum| I think change
16:13  Serpardum| not sure
16:13  Serpardum| + is added, - is deleted
16:16  SliMM| Hello
16:16  orbisvicis| ent process (caller) becomes the parent of the process with process ID pid. But a getpid()  by the child (the one being traced) returns the process ID of the real parent.
16:16  orbisvicis| What goes behind the scenes is that when a call is made, the usual permission checks are made along with whether the process is init or current or it is already traced. If there is no problem, permission is given and the flag is set. Now the links of the child process are rearranged; e.g., the child is removed from the task queue and its parent process field is changed (the original parent remains the same). It is put to the queue again in
16:16  orbisvicis| PTRACE_DETACH:
16:16  SliMM| I have an issue with my sound card, it is not recognized by the system and I can't figure out why...
16:17  orbisvicis| yikes wrong key combo
16:17  orbisvicis| ignore
16:18  fogobogo| SliMM: lspci?
16:18  SliMM| fogobogo: Yeah, that's the problem, it's not there
16:19  fogobogo| no idea :/
16:20  velcroshooz| SliMM, checked bios, made sure everything is on? what kind and model of sound?
16:20  SliMM| Intel AFAIK
16:21  velcroshooz| SliMM, integrated obviously, this on a lappy or what? some way we could look up the model?
16:21  xlq| I'm using Fluxbox. When I resize a window it takes about half a second after releasing the mouse button to actually resize. Did it do this before?
16:21  velcroshooz| without knowing what it is, we arent gonna go anywhere troubleshooting wise :/
16:21  xlq| One of the xorg-server upgrades was incompatible with fluxbox, but that seems to be fixed now.
16:23  SliMM| velcroshooz: Well, this would be the board: http://www.intel.com/Products/Desktop/Motherboards/D945GCLF/D945GCLF-overview.htm
16:23  phrik| Title: Intel® Desktop Board D945GCLF - Overview (at www.intel.com)
16:23  xlq| Have any other Fluxbox users noticed this?
16:24  DefunctProcess| xlq: not a flux user but noticed what?
16:24  synackfin| anyone know what happened to libgmp.so.3 ?
16:24  synackfin| I'm trying to compile gcc 4.4.2, and it's failing on missing libgmp.so.3
16:24  sudokode| what's the actual output?
16:25  sudokode| might to uh... what is it... pacman -Syu ?
16:25  SliMM| velcroshooz: The thing is, when I was installing the system, I heard the speaker, which was emulated through ALSA(?), so I don't think is the BIOS
16:26  SliMM| velcroshooz: I will check the BIOS as soon as I find a spare keyboard
16:26  sudokode| to basically update the package to the version that is required, plus update the symlink between the .so.version and its .so symlink
16:27  DarthPuff|  mkinitcpio -p kernel26-zen
16:27  DarthPuff| would this command rebuild my zen? the normal command doesn't have zen after it but i am using the zen kernel
16:28  DarthPuff| it did
16:28  ninjabox| DarthPuff: yeah I was gonna say I'd assume so =P
16:29  DarthPuff| ;)
16:29  DarthPuff| brb :D reboottttt
16:30  Serpardum| trying to install guestadditions in my archlinux.  can't mount cdrom so changing mtab.  What do I need in replace of the ??? in this line?   /dev/cdrom /mount/cdrom ???? rw 0 0
16:30  xlq| Serpardum: do you mean changing fstab?
16:30  Serpardum| no, mtab
16:30  xlq| I don't think you need to change mtab
16:30  Serpardum| I dont' want it permanent
16:30  Serpardum| it's an iso that I have to mount
16:31  Serpardum| wouldnt' that go into mtab/
16:31  Serpardum| ?
16:31  xlq| I don't know. Does changing mtab actually do anything?
16:31  xlq| Why can't you mount the cdrom anyway?
16:31  xlq| mount -r /dev/cdrom /mount/cdrom
16:31  xlq| ?
16:31  Serpardum| I've tried and get eh error that cdrom is not located in fstab or mtab
16:31  xlq| (/mnt/cdrom is more usual though...)
16:31  xlq| Serpardum: try it as root
16:32  xlq| Serpardum: also if you specify "noauto" in fstab it won't get mounted until you tell it to.
16:32  Serpardum| that did it
16:32  Serpardum| the -r I was missing
16:33  xlq| Well, -r means read-only there
16:33  xlq| I think mount will just issue a warning and mount it read-only without -r anyway.
16:34  Serpardum| it didn't, but reguardless, I got it mounted with mount -r /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
16:34  Serpardum| after I created the cdrom directory
16:34  DarthPuff| is the intel driver for xorg opensource?
16:34  Serpardum| this wiki needs to be fixed I think: http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/VirtualBox
16:34  phrik| Title: VirtualBox - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
16:35  Serpardum| It says to use the command "mount /media/cdrom" which does not work (or didnt' for me)
16:39  velcroshooz| Serpardum, so try the second option for installing them instead then
16:42  prometheanfire| what is the name of the new aur wrapper?
16:42  prometheanfire| I need to get rid of yaourt

16:43  DarthPuff| why would glxgears run 3.5 times faster as root?
16:43  Jonimus| DarthPuff: because you are not a member of the video group or the permissions are wrong on /dev/dri
16:43  DarthPuff| Jonimus: i'm in the video group
16:44  DarthPuff| Jonimus: what should the permissions on /dev/dri be?
16:44  Jonimus| let me see what they are on my system
16:46  velcroshooz| ARGH. ive got all of 'install from existing distro' wiki down pat except for the stupid grub install. NOTHING i do works, yet if i use a livecd of some other distro and install from it somehow grub loads. this is highly annoying, especially since i have no arch cds and this machine wont boot off usb.
16:46  Jonimus| mine has crw-rw----
16:46  Jonimus| which iirc is 660
16:47  DarthPuff| Jonimus: how do i check mine?
16:47  xlq| DarthPuff: Mine's root:video 660
16:47  xlq| DarthPuff: ls -l /dev/dri
16:47  DarthPuff| xlq: :)
16:47  DarthPuff| root video
16:47  DarthPuff| :\ hmmm
16:47  xlq| I'm in the video group, too. What a pleasant surprise!
16:47  DarthPuff| network video audio storage users my groups
16:48  xlq| Is that all?
16:48  DarthPuff| the system is pretty empty
16:48  xlq| users adm wheel uucp log games kvm dbus hal network video audio optical floppy storage power vboxusers freenet
16:48  DarthPuff| yikes
16:49  DarthPuff| what does power, hal, dbus, and adm do?
16:50  xlq| Can't remember what power is for. Probably so I can shut down. I just press my case power button though.
16:50  DarthPuff| heh
16:51  xlq| Hal...well I don't use hal, lol
16:51  DarthPuff| do any of those let you mount storage?
16:51  xlq| What's adm for?
16:51  DarthPuff| i have thunar and i'm in the storage group
16:51  xlq| DarthPuff: yeah, you can use HAL and dbus to mount and auto-mount stuff
16:51  DarthPuff| but when i click on a drive it gives me an error :\
16:52  xlq| DarthPuff: not sure about Thunar.
16:52  velcroshooz| DarthPuff, you starting your wm/de with a consolekit session? ie exec ck-launch-session moo in .xinitrc?
16:52  xlq| What's the adm group for? And why am I running dbus?
16:52  xlq| Oh, I think something breaks when I stop dbus.
16:52  velcroshooz| xlq, its your system, you tell us
16:53  xlq| velcroshooz: ;)
16:53  DarthPuff| velcroshooz: i startx from my inittab... my /etc/X11/init/initrc file has exec wicd & and awesome at the bottm... that is the extend of my wm really
16:54  xlq| Just a minute while I find out what breaks when I turn off dbus...
16:54  velcroshooz| DarthPuff, likely why your getting errors with thunar - you need to look into running a consolekit session - i dont know how that works with inittab
16:55  DarthPuff| velcroshooz: consolekit session. :) alright
16:56  xlq| O_o
16:56  xlq| xchat starts fluxbox
16:57  DarthPuff| lol
16:57  xlq| Wait, what did I just type? lol, I meant xchat starts dbus
16:57  xlq| Oh, adm is for log files
16:58  velcroshooz| wow dumbass move there. note to self - dont try mounting your swap from grub thinking its your root
16:58  xlq| velcroshooz: what happened?
16:59  DarthPuff| do you think compcache is worth it?
16:59  falconindy| DarthPuff: call me paranoid, but i don't trust it
16:59  xlq| falconindy: why not?
16:59  velcroshooz| xlq, just fighting a reinstall on this macbook, which has its own headaches. installing from a chrooted arch install on an ubuntu live cd ;p ive got to jump through stupid hoops with this lappy
17:00  DarthPuff| falconindy: i already did the tpmfs thing
17:00  DarthPuff| and reduced swapiness
17:00  DarthPuff| why would i also need to compcache ... that's what i think
17:00  falconindy| oh, compcache... not ccache
17:00  falconindy| no opinion, carry on
17:00  xlq| DarthPuff: you didn't put some swap space on a tmpfs, did you?
17:00  DarthPuff| This is also a good way to reduce disk read/write cycles on SSDs.
17:01  DarthPuff| that's what they say about it
17:01  xlq| falconindy: ccache is great though
17:01  DarthPuff| but it uses more cpu
17:01  falconindy| xlq: i can compile a kernel in under 10 minutes. i'd rather be assured that things are fresh
17:01  DarthPuff| lol
17:01  DarthPuff| i can compile a kernel in 5 hours
17:02  falconindy| eh, my .config is fairly bland. takes me almost half an hour to compile the vanilla arch kernel
17:03  xlq| falconindy: lucky you. For most people it takes much longer. ccache is very robust afaik though.
17:03  DarthPuff| falconindy: i have a 1.6 ghz atom :p
17:03  falconindy| im bored with this hardware. its a 3.16ghz C2D
17:03  xlq| ccache fixes what make left out
17:04  velcroshooz| gah i should have installed wicd before i reboot my chroot. :/
17:04  xlq| Reboot a chroot? O_o
17:05  velcroshooz| well reboot out of it - no network now that its running on its own ;p i got hasty
17:05  falconindy| i hear if you type 'sudo reboot' from inside a chroot, it turns your hard drive inside out.
17:05  xlq| How does reboot even work? Does it signal to PID 1?
17:06  falconindy| its essentially a shortcut to 'init 6'
17:06  poseidon| Sorry for my ignorance, but I'm trying to set up a server at my friends house that I can remotely log into from my house (both running arch).  How would I go about doing this?
17:06  xlq| Well, "telinit 6" :)
17:07  falconindy| well, except that telinit is a symlink to init =P
17:07  xlq| How does it tell the init process to switch runlevel, though?
17:07  velcroshooz| poseidon, well sshd is the best place to start, though you might want something more robust if you want a whole desktop vs just cli
17:07  falconindy| im sure its based on signals
17:07  poseidon| velcroshooz: I just want the cli.  I'll google sshd though
17:08  falconindy| !give poseidon wiki ssh
17:08  phrik| poseidon: SSH - ArchWiki: <http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH>
17:08  xlq| falconindy: hmm, it's the same binary. Well init is the first process to run and telinit tells init what to do, except init behaves like telinit when it's not the first process. Based on signals? Well I thought there was only four user-defined signals, and I don't know how to send extra information with a signal, do you?
17:08  xlq| Mb I should rtfs.
17:08  falconindy| xlq: behavior of signals is defined by the program itself
17:08  |littlebear|| falconindy: isn't sshd auto installed by Arch?
17:09  falconindy| |littlebear|: no
17:09  falconindy| xlq: some signals have universally defined behavior, but things like SIGHUP have to be defined "locally"
17:09  DarthPuff| reboot time
17:10  falconindy| xlq: e.g. as per the man page of init, 'kill -SIGHUP init' is the same as 'init q'
17:10  xlq| falconindy: :O
17:10  xlq| Aha, /dev/initctl is a fifo
17:10  xlq| What's runlevel q?
17:11  falconindy| 'tell init to re-examine the /etc/inittab file'
17:11  xlq| Ahh! That'll save a reboot!
17:11  falconindy| the only time you should ever need to reboot is a kernel panic or a kernel upgrade
17:11  xlq| or a kernel oops :)
17:12  falconindy| isn't that a combination of both a panic and an upgrade? ;)
17:12  delaman| im getting this in the command line now, "bash: /bin/ls: cannot execute binary file"
17:13  falconindy| delaman: how is that drive mounted? what options
17:13  velcroshooz| delaman, ouch, is / full?
17:13  xlq| delaman: uh oh, lol
17:13  delaman| velcroshooz: still have 1.7GB left
17:14  velcroshooz| well go with what falconindy said then, must be something else
17:14  telmich| good evening
17:14  falconindy| i'd ask for the output of mount, but....
17:14  xlq| delaman: file /bin/ls
17:15  telmich| I'm wondering where to find the kernel configuration of the kernel26 package, as pacman -Ql does not list any config file
17:15  falconindy| telmich: /proc/config.gz
17:16  telmich| falconindy: well, I'm on a self built kernel, as the arch one crashes too often
17:16  falconindy| telmich: then fetch the config out of ABS
17:16  VirtualDisaster| well ill say that i dont think ill be using xfs anymore

17:17  delaman| xlq: mkdir gives me the same thing

17:18  VirtualDisaster| Isola, man google provide NOOOO real answer
17:18  Operator23| Recently some files with AAC audio have begun playing incorrectly in mplayer
17:18  VirtualDisaster| i get the damn "special block missing" error
17:18  xlq| delaman: so what filesystem is this? What block device? Is it corrupt?
17:19  velcroshooz| delaman, you didnt install as i686 and are using x96_64 repos now by accident for some reason are you?
17:19  VirtualDisaster| and all the docs i found said basically youre screwed
17:19  Isola| VirtualDisaster: I see ;~;
17:19  velcroshooz| *x86_64
17:19  delaman| velcroshooz: no
17:19  poseidon| I'm installing arch on an older computer of mine.  When I'm trying to install the packages it says that the kernel package is invalad or currupted.  Does this mean that there was an error when writing the disk?
17:19  VirtualDisaster| so i dont see why xfs is around ...
17:19  Operator23| It works fine in vlc.
17:19  Operator23| I'm on x64.
17:19  adriano-src| hi people
17:19  xlq| velcroshooz: uh, but in that case file wouldn't think the headers are corrupt, right?
17:19  Operator23| Anyone else run into this or know a fix?
17:19  delaman| xlq: i think it is ext4
17:19  VirtualDisaster| cant even get data off .. man i need to reformat my backup disc now
17:19  velcroshooz| xlq, thats true - im fishing in the dark here ;)
17:19  adriano-src| did anyone try to install archlinux (archii) on nintendo Wii? :O
17:20  xlq| delaman: I think you might be screwed.
17:20  delaman| xlq: :'(
17:20  velcroshooz| adriano-src, wasnt even aware it existed. maybe there is a reason to knock the dust off my wii finally ;p
17:21  dknight| I am trying to install E17 from svn. should I configure it for /usr/local or just /usr?
17:21  xlq| dknight: /opt/e17 :)

17:23  busata| time to try new stuff & break things
17:23  adriano-src| velcroshooz: I seen archii videos on youtube it works. I tried and it works but kernel freeze
17:24  adriano-src| during kernel loading
17:24  telmich| now I'm wondering whether a) arch devs broke something with the kernel b) 2.6.33.2 is just broken (does not wake up sometimes) c) the bug is still persistent upstream ...
17:24  VirtualDisaster| 33 is broken
17:25  VirtualDisaster| i think many distros are skipping it
17:25  telmich| ahh, gtk :-)
17:25  xlq| gtk???
17:26  telmich| because loading acpi-cpufreq + cpufreq_ondemand and suspending = never suspend
17:26  VirtualDisaster| adriano-src, then it doesnt work :P
17:26  adriano-src| it works but init doesn't start I don't understand why :\
17:26  telmich| and even without it sometimes is unable to resume (no definite error reproduce there yet)
17:31  dknight| how do I have to set my PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable for /opt/e17?
17:32  soreau| ...
17:32  soreau| The same way you set any other environment variable?
17:32  telmich| what do you normally use to automatically reduce the backlight under x11? I'm currently using gnome-power-manager but was thinking of something without gnome

17:33  sudokode| to that matter
17:33  Borgasm| pacman -S e-svn for default e17 install

17:33  xlq| dknight: export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/e17/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
17:33  telmich| soreau: err, isn't there a general interface in the kernel for that?
17:33  xlq| O_o there's an E17 package, wow
17:33  telmich| xlq: yep, also one for hurd
17:34  xlq| Is it still crashy?
17:34  sudokode| e17?
17:34  telmich| hurd xorg linux or e17?
17:34  brain0| sudokode: what's new? the corruption?
17:34  dknight| e17 isn't crashy
17:34  sudokode| well, all the decompression times are new
17:34  xlq| e17
17:34  xlq| Isn't it? Hmm, was last two times I tried it.
17:35  sudokode| and yes, the decompression of xz in that matter fails every time
17:35  Borgasm| pretty stable for me
17:35  dknight| hmmm. interesting.what did you try on it?
17:35  VCoolio| xlq: using it for two years now; not crashy
17:35  sudokode| plus I guess the read times from hdparm
17:35  soreau| telmich: I don't really know
17:36  sudokode| not sure what I showed you last time
17:36  jwbirdsong| xlq: i installed it on an old core 2 duo  nvidia go 7400 just to see if it was 'still' buggy.. worked for me on that
17:36  velcroshooz| wicd is 202 megs on a fresh install? jeez
17:36  VirtualDisaster| velcroshooz, after or before download
17:37  dknight| xlq: e17 might have reduced functionality; but it is stable
17:37  dknight| xlq: and fast
17:37  velcroshooz| VirtualDisaster, oh after, its only a 30 meg download. id cry if the dl was that big :p
17:37  VirtualDisaster| lol
17:37  velcroshooz| finally getting around to reinstalling arch a non ghetto way on my macbook

11:15  scp1| Guys, why aint the colors in X and fb the same? For example http://data.fuskbugg.se/skalman01/xcolors.png vs http://data.fuskbugg.se/skalman01/fbcolors.png
11:17  scp1| nvm
11:17  |ast|| scp1: you bash prompt is cool
11:17  |ast|| :)
11:18  Mion| scp1: because you havn't read phraks blog
11:18         * sledgehammer sets the same colourset in .bashrc for console and Xdefaults for X
11:19         * sledgehammer has read phraks blog :)
11:22  scp1| mion, what?
11:22  scp1| sledgehammer, well, that's impossible it seems
11:22  scp1| since I use 256 colors in X
11:23  scp1| So I'll have to make another LS_COLORS variable
11:23  Mion| scp1: http://phraktured.net/linux-console-colors.html
11:23  phrik| Title: phraktured.net: Linux Console Colors (at phraktured.net)
11:23  tinflu| is there a way to disconnect an ssh user besides iptables filtering and killing his bash process ?
11:24  tinflu| ssh user should be ssh connection.
11:24  wonder| kill his session
11:24  scp1| mion, yeah, but that'll only be 16 colors
11:24  wonder| anything else i don't have in mind
11:24  tinflu| wonder: how can i do that
11:24  Mion| scp1: obviously
11:24  wonder| like you said, killing his bash process
11:24  scp1| and if one tries to use anything higher than that, it'll default to \033[30m
11:25  tinflu| ok thanks
11:25  scp1| \033[31;0m
11:25  Mion| scp1: unless you go and hack the linux kernel
11:25  scp1| what...
11:26  smau| yo
11:28  Mion| scp1: the linux console only supports 16 colours
11:28  Mion| you could hack in support for 256colours to it
11:28  scp1| mion, well... that depends
11:28  Mion| kms would actually make that easier
11:29  scp1| mion, one can see much more colors then 16 in the fb though
11:29  Mion| could have a 32bit colour space
11:29  scp1| maybe I should try kms, but - I dont dare right now
11:29  scp1| I'm pretty sure it'll take a week or so to get multihead working again...
11:30  Mion| !google the linux console the next generation tech blog
11:30  phrik| Mion: VMware: The Console: <http://blogs.vmware.com/console/>
11:30  Mion| bha
11:30  Mion| fuck you google
11:30  scp1| the intelfb2 looked awesome
11:30  Mion| there is a blog post about the next gen(tm) console
11:30  Mion| 32bit colour space, none of the old crappy 1970 compatible crud
11:31  Mion| eg, not optimized to work on a 2k4 baud connection
11:31  demonicmaniac| just sure directfb-term :)
11:31  demonicmaniac| er
11:31  demonicmaniac| s/sure/use/
11:31  scp1| mion, how come one can see for example png's with full colorspace in the fb, and not use extended colors in the console?
11:31  scp1| the LS_COLORS variable aint supposed to support more then 16 colors either
11:31         -!- o_a is now known as o_a|away
11:31  demonicmaniac| because one thing is framebuffer
11:32  demonicmaniac| the other is the virtual console
11:32  scp1| Well, what I mean is; fbterm, or something like that, should be able to handle it
11:32  scp1| fbterm didnt work very nicely for me though
11:32  Mion| the serial console compability crud should die
11:32  demonicmaniac| scp1: yeah that's why i said dfb-term
11:32  scp1| I dont use directfb though
11:33  Mion| and a new and modern console should be born
11:33  scp1| it didnt work very well that either...
11:33  demonicmaniac| multi directfb is a bitch
11:33  scp1| I have a pretty weird setup
11:33  demonicmaniac| and with KMS it's a pita as well
11:33  scp1| Since only one of the monitors I have can use the native resolution in fb
11:33  Mion| demonicmaniac: with kms you wouldn't need directfb
11:33  scp1| even though they are identical except for the interface
11:34  demonicmaniac| Mion: well. FB still is character based with kms FB
11:34  demonicmaniac| directfb isn't
11:34  scp1| but now, I dont even get native resolution with that, neither with vesafb, nor with uvesafb
11:34  Mion| and there would be no more problems with gfx cards that only support some resolutions in the console
11:34  scp1| or, directfb
11:34  demonicmaniac| e.g. links -g directfb vs fb
11:35  demonicmaniac| or to be more precise: gpm is character based
11:35  scp1| demonicmaniac, could you take a shot of how it looks like using the dfbterm?
11:35  demonicmaniac| and directfb handles mouse itself
11:35  Mion| demonicmaniac: that's partly the point of the next gen console, it won't be character based anymore
11:35  scp1| I would be so awesome if one could use multihead in NATIVE resolution :c
11:35  Mion| sadly, it's nothing more than the idea of a insane blogger at this time :(
11:35  demonicmaniac| Mion: i still think dfb has its place, mostly in point of sale and embedded
11:36  demonicmaniac| just wish directfb multi wasn't such a bitch
11:36  demonicmaniac| with gtk2-dfb that would be really swell without X
11:36  demonicmaniac| or is swell for the people that manage to not have their kernel oops all the time >.>
11:36  demonicmaniac| with linux-fusion
11:37  scp1| I dont need gtk2 in fb, I just want native resolution and > 16 colors :c
11:37  demonicmaniac| well with pango and cairo you wouldn't need the still not so nice fbgs way of reading pdf in framebuffer
11:38  scp1| Why aint there some cursesbased pdf-reader/browser
11:38  scp1| wouldnt be that hard, just parse the text?
11:39  sbpaul| scp1: pdftotext
11:39  scp1| yeah.
11:39  sbpaul| apvlv is GUI but it's lightweight
11:39  scp1| yeah, it's great.
11:39  sbpaul| just pipe pdftotext to less
11:39  demonicmaniac| there is fbgs
11:40  demonicmaniac| i usually do pdf2html
11:40  demonicmaniac| and use links -g
11:41  Mion| I use xpdf
11:41  JavaAtom| xpdf ftw
11:41  demonicmaniac| Mion: but vim syntax !
11:41  JavaAtom| xpdf totally rocks when writing latex docs.
11:41  demonicmaniac| errr....s/syntax/style commands/
11:42  demonicmaniac| zathura looks really lovely too
11:42  Gadget3000| I find xpdf works well when you have images on the document
11:42  JavaAtom| split a window with vim to write the doc and a xpdf window to refresh with one button.
11:43         * Mion uses dvi to preview *tex stuff instead of pdf
11:43  Mion| since it's faster
11:43  tlonim| sbpaul: but scrolling in apvlv has some issues..
11:43         * demonicmaniac uses djvu since he found it to be smaller
11:44  tlonim| sbpaul: or atleast had
11:44  sbpaul| does it?
11:44  sbpaul| i don't have any problems
11:44  Gadget3000| I've started using TexMaker to write tex stuff rather than command line. Easier to understand but...
11:44  Gadget3000| ...it's just...not quite right
11:52  spiky25| someone is good with tv tuner and kernel recompiling ???
11:55  sveinemann| Hm, if x is started resume from suspend fails and it reboots. Not if x is closed. Funny.
11:56  Mion| sveinemann: gfx driver and card?
11:56  skazhy| Hi! I have some problems with postgreSQL. I run /etc/rc.d/postgresql start and it says [done]. But when I try /etc/rc.d/postgresql stop it says - pg_ctl: PID file"/var/lib/postgres/data/postmaster.pid" does not exist..[fail]. Whats wrong?
11:57  Mion| check if it's actually running at all
11:57  Stalafin| assume i want to search my weechat logs (with less?) containing my name, an arbitrary number of characters and foo, how could i do that? /NAME*foo does not really cut it...
11:57  skazhy| Mion, nope it's not
11:57  velcroshooz| is there any method to ignore size hints in openbox?
11:58  gnubien| spiky25: http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki
11:58  phrik| Title: LinuxTVWiki (at www.linuxtv.org)
11:58  sveinemann| Mion: how do I check what card I have?
11:58  Mion| lspci
11:59  Mion| or open the case
12:00  sveinemann| Mion: its Intel GMA 4500MHD
12:01  Mion| and you are using the -intel driver?
12:01  sveinemann| Mion: im running xorg without xorg.conf.
12:01  demonicmaniac| with kms it ought not make a difference whether X is running or not.no ?
12:03  multi8| sveinemann: xf86-video-intel installed ?
12:03  sveinemann| yep
12:03  orschiro| does anyone know how to add a template in console vim from vim-latexsuite? I don't understand the meaning of "Templates are also accessible for non-gui users with the command |:TTemplate|."
12:03  Mion| :h TTemplate
12:04         * XAVeRY failed miserably.
12:05  Mion| phrik: XAVeRY is <fails> miserably.
12:05  phrik| Mion: Tada!
12:05  orschiro| ah have it. thank you Mion :)
12:05  Mion| bha
12:05  Mion| phrik: no,XAVeRY is <reply>$nick fails miserably.
12:06  phrik| Mion: Tada!
12:06  XAVeRY| lol
12:06  Mion| better :)
12:06  Mion| !XAVeRY
12:06  phrik| XAVeRY is <fails> miserably.
12:06  XAVeRY| !XAVeRY
12:06  phrik| XAVeRY is <fails> miserably.
12:06  Mion| hmm
12:06  XAVeRY| I can live with that.
12:06  Mion| fixed
12:07  Mion| !XAVeRY
12:07  phrik| Mion fails miserably.

12:09  spiky25| !chuck
12:10  spiky25| that bot sucks
12:10  demonicmaniac| !chuck is <reply>
12:11  sveinemann| Is it Xorg -configure we use these days to make an xorg.conf?
12:11  demonicmaniac| sveinemann: depends on your card
12:11  demonicmaniac| nvidia has its own tool
12:11  sveinemann| demonicmaniac: intel card
12:11  Jonimus| sveinemann: give it a try without a card and see what happens
12:11  velcroshooz| no matter what i set my colors or themes too cli irc just kills my eyes after awhile. being able to screen just isnt worth it for me :/
12:11  Tarinaky| sveinemann: You may not need an xorg.conf at all.
12:12  Jonimus| velcroshooz: you clearly need a better terminal then
12:12  scp1| better font
12:12  Mion| velcroshooz: uhm, then irc will always kill your eyes
12:12  velcroshooz| Jonimus, urxvt and custom colors. i dont know what else i could do.
12:13  Mion| velcroshooz: because there isn't any difference between cli irc and "gui" irc
12:13  sveinemann| Tarinaky: if i dont use xorg.conf i think it uses vesa instead of the intel drive.r
12:13  Mion| it's just text after all
12:13  sveinemann| how can i check witch driver is loaded when im not using xorg.conf?
12:13  Mion| sveinemann: read the xorg log
12:13  Jonimus| sveinemann: not at all, just check your xorg.0.log
12:14  velcroshooz| Mion, i suppose, ive been trying to use terminus in urxvt, and i just cant handle it in irc. too small, and there is not enough definition between lines in irssi/weechat.
12:14  scp1| bump up the size then
12:14  scp1| or try profont
12:14  Mion| velcroshooz: you can alwayws use bitsream or something for irc
12:14  velcroshooz| maybe im doing it wrong, but it seems terminus has a limit
12:14  Mion| bitstream*
12:14  velcroshooz| (size wise)
12:15  scp1| yeah, 32
12:15  scp1| :p
12:15  Mion| velcroshooz: fyi you can have several "profiles" for urxvt, you don't have to use the same font in all of the windows
12:15  Mion| you can even change the font at runtime
12:15  Mion| try a non-monospace font for irc
12:16  Mion| might be more readable
12:16  scp1| velcroshooz, try http://github.com/trapd00r/pickyfont
12:16  phrik| Title: trapd00r's pickyfont at master - GitHub (at github.com)
12:16  velcroshooz| maybe ill try that then - terminus is fine for me in normal terminal usage, its just irc
12:16  cleancode| Where can I set firefox file assocition? I am using pure openbox.
12:16  Mion| cleancode: install perl-file-mimeinfo and play with xdg-*
12:16  Jonimus| non-monospace for irc what madness is this
12:16  cleancode| Mion: thank you
12:17  scp1| I use terminus in Fx too. It's the most readable font I've seen tbh. But for the terminals and coding I now use profont since it's smaller
12:17  JavaAtom| I can't even figure out what my fonts are set to... >.>
12:18  velcroshooz| i should ignore joins parts in cli irc to help too, but that bugs me. id rather just pull the hostnames out so they are smaller. that is so much easier in xchat than irssi heh.
12:18  JavaAtom| I remember finding one a while back and just keeping it.
12:18  Mion| velcroshooz: weechat!
12:18  Mion| velcroshooz: it has a really nice filtering function
12:19  velcroshooz| yeah. i need to put in some work on weechat. ive run it, but never tried to customize it.
12:19  scp1| Well ignoring all non-msg spam is a good start
12:19  Mion| velcroshooz: since you filter them instead of ignore them, they are toggleable for the times you want to see them
12:21  velcroshooz| as many machines as im on in my house screen and a cli irc program is  ideal - i just need to find a happy medium
12:22  LordMetroid| Ohh dear my graphics drivers has failed
12:22  LordMetroid| Even rendering a new line in the terminal is slow
12:24  scp1| http://jonls.dk/redshift/ hah, wth
12:24  phrik| Title: Redshift « jonls devblog (at jonls.dk)
12:24  Edward226| how come most man pages havent been working on my system lately?
12:25  demonicmaniac| clean is even smaller
12:25  demonicmaniac| and artwiz fonts <3
12:25  scp1| they're nice but not working for coding
12:26  demonicmaniac| scp1: they are for me
12:26  demonicmaniac| :)
12:26  scp1| 32pt? :<
12:27  wonder| guys there is way to see what vimfiles my vim uses?
12:27  velcroshooz| pardon my love for gui but i really wish there was something akin to xchat that had a client/server model, so i could run an irc daemon/server on a box and connect to it with multiple clients on diff machines
12:28  Mion| wonder: as to see what it has sourced?
12:28  wonder| Mion, yes
12:28  busata| hmm, thunar being weird, I can open a folder, but then can't click anything in it anymore, unless I open a new window for it
12:28  Mion| wonder: don't think so
12:28  Blaargh| there's quassel that does that velcroshooz
12:28  Blaargh| yeah,known bug busata. use one of the other views for now
12:28  velcroshooz| busata, documented gtk bug in thunar and pcmanfm - stay out of detail view or switch to single clicks
12:28  wonder| Mion, damn. then is kinda hard to debug my issue
12:29  busata| ah, ok, thanks
12:29  busata| bugs are so awesome sometimes
12:29  scj| velcroshooz: irc bouncer?
12:29  velcroshooz| im actually pretty use to single click now, because i couldnt give up detail view ;)
12:30  axion| lol at clicking files
12:30  Mion| wonder: try debugging mode tho
12:30  wonder| Mion, did you noticed syntax color changes when editing PKGBUILDs while using vim from testing?
12:30  scp1| wonder, strace vim, and you'll see what it opens
12:30  Mion| wonder: hm, don't think so
12:30  Blaargh| velcroshooz, tried quassel?
12:31  Mion| wonder: :h debug-scripts
12:31  velcroshooz| Blaargh, no, i thought that was a proxy irc deal, so never looked into it
12:31  Blaargh| no, it's a graphic client with your desired server - client architecture
12:31         * Mion have testing disabled atm because of the silly catalsyt driver
12:32  scj| why would you need a client server irc client?
12:32  wonder| nothing in testing now that can have a connection with catalyst :)
12:32  velcroshooz| i pulled in the new vim/gvim this morning but havent played with it
12:32  demonicmaniac| wonder: nope doesn't hightlight for me
12:32  Mion| wonder: not now, but before the cleanup there was :)
12:32  wonder| scj, as a bouncer
12:32  Yumi| reuh
12:32  wonder| demonicmaniac, let me show you what i'm talking about
12:33  scj| wonder: so use a bouncer
12:33  wonder| scj, correct
12:33  lubosz| hi
12:33  Mion| wonder: or rather, before someone managed to write a .33 patch for catalyst
12:33  demonicmaniac| wonder: i know i have that pkgbuild syntax on my other older lappie
12:33  Mion| I just havn't gotten around to enable it again
12:33  lubosz| is there a way to compile wine without gcc multilib or chrooting in a x86 env?
12:33  demonicmaniac| but that was from aur
12:33  lubosz| gcc multi lib is not THAT maintained
12:34  demonicmaniac| just updated from testing and PLKBUILD doesn't color
12:34  Turski| i'm just waiting for nvidia driver that supports xserver 1.8
12:34  demonicmaniac| *PKGBUILD
12:34  wonder| demonicmaniac, version from extra: http://omploader.org/vNDdlYg
12:34  wonder| demonicmaniac, version from testing: http://omploader.org/vNDdlOQ
12:34  wonder| pacman-contrib installed as it has a schema
12:34  velcroshooz| Turski, there is always IgnoreABI or nouveau atm
12:34  wonder| Turski, it does
12:35  Mion| testing looks better
12:35  wonder| it has unofficial support for xorg 1.8 like is wrote in changelog from nvidia
12:35         -!- xenor_ is now known as xenor
12:35  Mion| maybe someone updated the .vim for PKGBUILDs in the testing pkg?
12:35  wonder| Mion, yeah. nothing fun in it
12:36  wonder| no diff between archlinux.vim
12:36  velcroshooz| was there anything special with the new procinfo or was that just a rename?
12:36  Mion| hm
12:36         * Mion updates to testing
12:36  wonder| Mion, the thing is the color is broken even if pacman-contrib is removed
12:37  wonder| my guess is that some schema from vim-runtime has changed upstream between versions
12:37  Mion| I actually like the testing version better >_>
12:37  Mion| yea
12:37  somnambulant| wow so you have to have ubuntu to by music from UbuntuOne music store?
12:37  Ghost1227| Mion: i didn't change a thing with highlighting
12:38  Ghost1227| :(
12:38  Mion| Ghost1227: let's blame allan then
12:38  Mion| :p
12:38  Turski| wonder: oh, i haven't noticed that
12:38  Ghost1227| Mion: can't blame allan when i'm responsible for vim now
12:38  Wintervenom| somnambulant:  Does it even have anything worth buying?  :P
12:38  wonder| Mion, for ( and ) color is different than [ ]
12:38  Mion| sure we can
12:38  daevski| What (video) player can chain .VOB files (so that I can just open file01 of a dvd and have it play throughout) ?
12:38  wonder| so i guess is an upstream bug
12:38  Mion| :p
12:38  Wintervenom| daevski:  I think VLC and SMPlayer can do that.
12:39  Turski| daevski: mplayer
12:39  VirtualDisaster| daevski, any media player
12:39  wonder| for {} too
12:39  wonder| damn!
12:39  VirtualDisaster| just open the dir
12:39  wonder| i want to kill someone:D
12:39  somnambulant| Wintervenom: according to this article it does: http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/opensource/?p=1447
12:39  phrik| Title: UbuntuOne Music Store: How a music service should be | Linux and Open Source | TechRepublic.com (at blogs.techrepublic.com.com)
12:39  Mion| in the testing one, the --flags gets coloured correcty tho
12:39  somnambulant| Wintervenom: but I guess you have to use Rhythmbox with ubuntu/ubuntuone service to find out
12:39  Wintervenom| daevski:  Bash can do it, too:  `for movie in *.VOB; do mplayer $movie; done
12:39  Wintervenom| `
12:40  Turski| but actually you want to play it using dvd-protocol
12:40  JohannesSM64| don't actually include the backticks though :)
12:40  Mion| wonder: sh.vim probably changed upstream
12:40  Mion| wonder: since PKGBUILD.vim sources it
12:40  velcroshooz| not that i run ubuntu but boy that dissapoints me. free software with locked in services. yuck.
12:40  wonder| hmm
12:40  daevski| Wintervenom, I thought if you just played them in sequence that you might get other languages on different chuncks... I've seen that before.
12:40  wonder| let me diff it
12:40  velcroshooz| its the apple of the linux world
12:41  Turski| daevski: mplayer dvd://1 -dvd-device location
12:42  daevski| Turski, k thanks. I'll try it.
12:42  axion| wont always work. title 1 is not always the feature
12:42  daevski| axion, right
12:42  wonder| yeah baby!
12:42  wonder| Mion, rulz
12:42  Turski| axion: then just try to find the right one
12:43  axion| lol fail
12:43  Mion| daevski: mplayer with dvdnav enabled
12:43  Mion| !next
12:43  phrik| Another satisfied customer! NEXT!
12:43  Turski| Mion: that's buggy as hell ;/

12:43  wonder| Ghost1227, yeah
12:43  Mkman| hey
12:43  daevski| Mion, Okay, thanks
12:43  wonder| Ghost1227, i used syntax sh.vim from the old package
12:44  Turski| Mion: wasn't at least last time i tried that

12:44  Ghost1227| wonder: can the PKGBUILD.vim be patched to handle things cleaner?

12:45  demonicmaniac| even with mplayer nice -n -20
12:45  daevski| Mion, well that's how I ripped them long ago. Maybe I'll just mkiso on them soon.
12:45  demonicmaniac| i get skips with another prio 20 process eating cp
12:45  demonicmaniac| u
12:45  demonicmaniac| :/
12:45  Mion| Ghost1227: some things could possibly be submitted to sh.vim too, eg different highlithing for --enable and --disable and similar
12:46  wonder| Ghost1227, no idea
12:48  wonder| the thing is the green text from my picture is the color scheme from my terminal
12:48  Mion| demonicmaniac: what gfx card do you have?
12:48  demonicmaniac| firegl t2
12:48  wonder| and in the latest sh.vim this is overwrote
12:49  demonicmaniac| works fine without anything else hogging the cpu 100%
12:49  demonicmaniac| might also be the cpufreq since it's a loop with xargs
12:49  Mion| demonicmaniac: no vaapi or similar then probably :/
12:49  demonicmaniac| so it might drop and go up which causes skips

12:50  wonder| Ghost1227, we can't do much than notify upstream that they broke sh.vim :P
12:51  Ghost1227| alright
12:51  uhsf| What is the best way to ensure network connection will not be lost with a remote computer? I wish there was a "reboot-on-lan" signal similar to "wake-on-lan" to restart network if connection was broken by error. The best idea I found yet is running a script like "ping -c 1 google.com\ check the return value (0 if successfull)\ while true sleep for some time" and reboot system if network connection is down. Do you know about such a scr

13:22  scp1| hatten, "one of few", the "few" part was refering to ratpoison
13:22  Mion| cdahmedeh: on modern hardware you won't feal a difference
13:22  hatten| scp1: aha, ratpoison is "one of few" too
13:23  lilltiger| hatten: well dm_crypt shouldent change that much..

13:23  ulughbegh| Mion, +1
13:23  ulughbegh| cdahmedeh, !?
13:24  cdahmedeh| i mean do gtk apps look like kde apps in kde ?
13:24  cdahmedeh| like is the equivalent of qgtkstyle for gtk in kde ?
13:24  busata| it's the window manager that defines the borders, I think(?)
13:24  ulughbegh| yeah there is
13:24  Mion| you can make them more or less the same

13:37  hatten| scp1: well, I'm quite happy with my setup, and I would say ratpoison is hackable in realtime (it's really easy to restart it)
13:37  ulughbegh| pytyle is very nice though
13:38  hatten| scp1: so it would be if I wanted dualhead, but atm I actually don't have a gfx card for that =p

13:52  gavino| http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Firewall
13:52  phrik| Title: Firewalls - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
13:52  gavino| blam!
13:52  evanton| Blaargh: if I would have a shell script that would contain call to iptables for setting firewall rules, where would it be the best place in the boot scripts to hook it up? doesn't arch have a stub?
13:52  evanton| gavino: stop trolling me please
13:53  scp1| rc.local
13:53  evanton| rc.local is too late
13:53  scp1| or better yet, make yourself a daemon
13:53  scp1| why?
13:53  scp1| rc.sysinit?
13:53  evanton| scp1: because I'd like the firewall rules to be set up before starting the network daemons
13:54  evanton| such a workflow is an adequate one
13:54  scp1| evanton, well, first off... why dont you just use iptables to set up and save the rules?
13:54  scp1| and then just add iptables before network in the daemons array
13:54  evanton| scp1: that's what I'm going to do - use iptables directly. I'm just truing to find out the right place in the boot scrips in arch
13:55  evanton| scp1: by "daemons array" you mean DAEMONS in /etc/rc.conf? I'm kinda new to arch and can fail to get you right from the start
13:55  Blaargh| yes he does
13:56  evanton| I'm not sure how this fits, iptables is not a daemon which has a config file, right?
13:57  evanton| so I find it confusing to see an analogy between iptables and daemons, unless I still fail to understand the point
13:58  Blaargh| http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Iptables <--yes, you apparently do

14:00  scp1| evanton, just add your rules, and save them. Add iptables to the daemons array, and you're done
14:01  scp1| you dont wanna hack on the initscript
14:01  Blaargh| did you read the wiki entry at all evanton?
14:01  evanton| scp1: "add rules" == manually?
14:01  velcroshooz| Blaargh, of course not
14:01  evanton| I see
14:01  cdahmedeh| WOW KDE IS FAST
14:01  scp1| evanton, well... uh... are there an automated way? :s
14:01  cdahmedeh| AMAZING, what did other distros do to kde ?
14:01  JannoT| cdahmedeh, since when?
14:02  evanton| thanks for the pointers, going to read the docs
14:02  Huulivoide| cdahmedeh: or then you are just slow
14:02  gavino| i use icewm
14:02  gavino| :)
14:02  gavino| ;)
14:02  cdahmedeh| yes i am slow, remember it's just a few weeks since i've been using arch, i was using xfce
14:02  cdahmedeh| and now i'm trying kde, but it's the same speed
14:02  cdahmedeh| very impressive
14:03  scp1| you should try stumpwm and you'll get a heart attack
14:03         -!- Wintervenom[2] is now known as Wintervenom
14:03  velcroshooz| fast in text with tilers and fast in a gui are two diff things though imo
14:03  gavino| I got 187M/s on my softwre raid array raid10 NICE
14:03  gavino| I love myself
14:03  scp1| velcroshooz, stop doint that!
14:03  cdahmedeh| i get like 90 on my 7200rpm laptop hardrive !
14:03  scp1| velcroshooz, ONE CAN USE GUI APPS in a tiling wm
14:04  velcroshooz| scp1, some dont want to work right though, but i know. ive got awesome all decked out on here too.
14:04  scp1| velcroshooz, Now you gonna mention gimp
14:04  scp1| velcroshooz, and I will mention dynamic tilers
14:04  scp1| :)
14:05  velcroshooz| scp1, nono ;) gimp is its own problem, though i hear newest ver kills all that
14:05  scp1| yeah it's sad
14:05  scp1| I dont get why they are changing it
14:05  velcroshooz| yeah according to linux format newest ver is going single window
14:05  scp1| yeah, sucks
14:06  scp1| So then I cant use one monitor for the image, and one for the panels
14:06  scp1| most graphic artists have more then 1 monitor
14:07  velcroshooz| scp1, its really a necessity if you draw and use your comp for normal operations at the same time
14:07  trifler| and an a3 wacomboard.
14:07  scp1| what do you mean?
14:07  velcroshooz| scp1, multiple monitors
14:08  trifler| velcroshooz: virtual desktops would handle that though. I mean if you can draw on one screen and workd "normal" on the other one.
14:08  scp1| velcroshooz, yeah, and for gimp with splitted windows, it was so easy to have an awesome workflow using only 2 monitors
14:08  velcroshooz| multiple monitors + synergy to others comps, i have alot of workspace ;)
14:09  FliPPeh| Has anyong gotten experience with NFS? Seems like the user and group IDs are overflowing, and one the client side it becomes... [quote="ls -l"]

14:09  FliPPeh| UID of 429467294...
14:09  velcroshooz| scp1, i think your in the minority on this topic though. not that i agree but people have been bitching about gimps setup for 10 years ;p
14:10  scp1| they have? what are their arguments? :s
14:10  FliPPeh| Seems like a server issue, I have it on all clieents
14:11  velcroshooz| scp1, i couldnt give you specifics but ever since i found linux ive heard the gimp debates. they are always trying to make it more like photoshop
14:11  yitz_| !give me wiki bin32-skype
14:11  grawity| FliPPeh: It's root_squash. root is mapped to 'nfsnobody'.
14:11  phrik| me: Skype - ArchWiki: <http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Skype>
14:11  velcroshooz| im more on an inkscape user myself
14:11  scp1| velcroshooz, there's gimpshop for that...
14:11  scp1| velcroshooz, :( stupid users
14:11  velcroshooz| yep
14:12  hatten| they should make one/several windows a commandline argument
14:12  JavaAtom| scp1: There's a reason they used to call them (l)users
14:12  FliPPeh| grawity: Do you mean the /etc/exports setting?
14:12  Stalafin| is the name i use for my public ssh-keys important? i have used foo for the key, copied foo.pub over to the host, added it to authorized_keys; however, when i ssh into the machine, i get the output 'Host ... is known and matches the RSA host key' and "found key in ~/.ssh/known_hosts"; later it says "Trying private key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa" and "[...]/id_dsa"
14:12  hatten| or maybe a checkbox inside =p
14:12  scp1| velcroshooz, oh well, I mostly use Perl::Magick nowadays, but all operations cant be done with that either
14:12  grawity| Stalafin: Which one are you asking about? id_rsa.pub or authorized_keys?
14:13  JannoT| hatten, no, radiobutton!
14:13  Stalafin| grawity: well, does ssh always check for my id_rsa.pub?
14:13  hatten| JannoT: huh, what's a radiobutton?
14:13  scp1| lol
14:13  grawity| Stalafin: ssh never checks the .pub files. They're only for convienence.
14:14         * hatten thinks mouses and everything they are associated is strange
14:14  grawity| Stalafin: ssh only uses the private key files (which in fact have both keys in one)
14:14  hatten| !mouse
14:14  digitteknohippie| like a checkbox, except checkboxes are select multiple options, radio buttons are "OR"
14:14  phrik| Throw away the mouse, and get productive in X!
14:14  trifler| hatten: like a checkbox only you put a block dot in it. :)
14:14  grawity| Stalafin: So, the filenames.
14:14  hatten| trafim: lol
14:14  grawity| Stalafin: If you specify a path with ssh -i, it uses that path.
14:14  Stalafin| grawity: wel, alright; but, can i name my keys whatever i want?
14:14  trifler| hatten: ofcourse you can't make multiple choices using them.
14:14  grawity| Stalafin: Otherwise, if there's a path specified in ~/.ssh/config, that one is used.
14:14  trifler| hatten: just like digitteknohippie said.
14:14  grawity| Stalafin: Otherwise, ssh checks the default location - ~/.ssh/id_rsa
14:15  hatten| aha
14:15  Stalafin| grawity: what if i have several keys for different hosts?
14:15         * hatten learned how to use some english words today, yay!
14:15  grawity| Stalafin: You can use any filename you want. You can even assign keys to hosts in ~/.ssh/config.
14:15  scp1| hatten, you dont own a mouse either? nice man
14:15  scp1| or were you talking about irl-mouses?
14:15  Stalafin| grawity: i see, thank you!
14:15  grawity| Stalafin: The ~/.ssh/id_rsa default path is just ... well, like any other default. A well-known location to check when nothing else works.
14:16  digitteknohippie| if it werent for the likes of my creative apps, i'd renounce the mouse too.
14:16  grawity| Stalafin: But I would put the "global" key to ~/.ssh/id_rsa anyway.
14:16         -!- Wintervenom[2] is now known as Wintervenom
14:16  Stalafin| grawity: global?
14:16  velcroshooz| yeah. minus LOGO drawing with the keyboard sucks. silly turtles.
14:16  grawity| Stalafin: Do you use a separate key for every host?
14:16  hatten| scp1: well, I do own a mouse, or several, but none is plugged in. I use a trackball for gaming (but it isn't plugged in either
14:17  scp1| hatten, fair enough
14:17  Stalafin| grawity: not quite; this is the first key i use at all; i just thought it would be a good manner to use several keys
14:17  Stalafin| grawity: but i guess, i don't have to
14:17  sacarde| someone has kdemod3? and have problems after ssl upgrade ?
14:17  scp1| lol
14:17  scp1| That issue is like 2 weeks old
14:17  hatten| scp1: it must be about 2 weeks since I used a pointer last time
14:17  grawity| Stalafin: Most people use a single key for all hosts. Others have separate keys for "critical" systems and a single global key for "the rest".
14:17  scp1| hatten, I stopped using it when I found rp
14:17  scp1| quite a while now, and it's so awesome
14:17  scp1| especially for the wrists
14:17  Stalafin| grawity: however... turns out, everytime i ssh into the host, he now asks me for the key's passphrase; i thought i could circumvent that with a key... what's the advantage having a key then?
14:18  hatten| scp1: it's needet at some websites (first class for school O_O)
14:18  grawity| Stalafin: The advantage of having a key is that you can prove that you have it without actually revealing it.
14:18  hatten| scp1: and for gaming
14:18  scp1| hatten, what? a mouse for websites?
14:18  scp1| hatten, flash?
14:18  grawity| Stalafin: As in, the public part is sent - and the private one can stay secret.
14:18  grawity| Stalafin: Unlike passwords.
14:18  scp1| hatten, you can solve that by removing flash
14:18  hatten| scp1: nope, flash isn't installed ;)
14:18         * scp1 makes love with hatten 
14:18  grawity| Stalafin: About the key's passphrase. There are two methods: empty passphrase, or ssh-agent.
14:18  hatten| scp1: I have no clue what their webinterface is, but it sucks hard
14:19         * hatten lulz
14:19  grawity| Stalafin: The first is - obviously - removing a passphrase from the key. If you are confident about your own computer's security, it's not a bad thing.
14:19  hatten| scp1: they've done their best to copy the programs interface to the webinterface, so it's possible to move around the inbox (it's an icon)
14:20  grawity| Stalafin: The second is ssh-agent. When you start the computer and login, you get asked for the key's passphrase and it gets loaded to agent's memory.
14:20  scp1| hatten, :s uh ok
14:20  hatten| scp1: altough the page have to reload after everything you do
14:20  grawity| Stalafin: Then every time you run 'ssh' it grabs everything from agent.
14:20  grawity| Stalafin: Do you use GNOME, KDE, or anything like that?
14:20  hatten| scp1: google for some first class images
14:20  Stalafin| grawity: i use KDE, but i would prefer to use the command line for this anyhow
14:21  Stalafin| grawity: switching to things like xmonad from time to time
14:21  scp1| hatten, http://www.topxgames.com/bigfish/first-class-flurry/screen2.jpg ?
14:21  grawity| Stalafin: I was only asking because GNOME has its own, more integrated agent -- but the "normal" one is okay too.
14:21  hatten| scp1: evil you, I don't want to manually copy that just to see it
14:21  grawity| Stalafin: So 1) Starting the agent. eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
14:21  sudokode| that looks that a boring game
14:22  sudokode| like*
14:22  hatten| scp1: it's obviously not a game =p
14:22  Stalafin| grawity: i found this: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ssh-password-less-login-with-dsa-publickey-authentication/ there they tell you to first 'exec /usr/bin/ssh-agent $SHELL' i don't quite get the point of this
14:22  scp1| hatten, use the screen copy buffer you noob
14:22  phrik| Title: Howto Linux / UNIX setup SSH with DSA public key authentication (password less login) (at www.cyberciti.biz)
14:22  hatten| scp1: I'm not in screen, and how would I select text in irssi?
14:22  sudokode| use gpm, highlight it, middle click
14:22  grawity| Stalafin: Tutorials like that can die in a fire. As an Arch user I prefer to learn/teach the simple way first
14:22  scp1| you should have irssi in screen you noob
14:23  sudokode| using a mouse in a console?! :o
14:23  grawity| Stalafin: But yeah, that exec thing achieves mostly the same results: $SSH_AUTH_SOCK in environment.
14:23  scp1| gpm will do wonders since he dont have a mouse
14:23  sudokode| booo
14:23  grawity| Stalafin: (now that I think of it, may be even a little better)
14:23  velcroshooz| so screen is the only option
14:24  grawity| Stalafin: Either way. Start the agent, and 2) run ssh-add to load the key.
14:24  hatten| scp1: but still, I don't understand how I would mark text, as I'm mouseless
14:25  loonyphoenix| is there a way to disconnect a process from a terminal without stopping it?
14:25  hatten| scp1: does shift+numlock work in screen?
14:25  Stalafin| grawity: can you explain this to me? $SSH_AUTH_SOCK in environment? what's the purpose of this?
14:25  scp1| hatten, what... you just use the screen copy mode
14:25  Mion| or use passwordless keys
14:26  jason^| loonyphoenix: ctrl+z, bg should do it, but if you exit the terminal it'll kill itself
14:26  hatten| scp1: oh, that means reading man pages
14:26  scp1| hatten, http://www.samsarin.com/blog/2007/03/11/gnu-screen-working-with-the-scrollback-buffer/
14:26  phrik| Title: GNU Screen: Working with the Scrollback Buffer Samsarin (at www.samsarin.com)
14:26  jason^| loonyphoenix: or if you didn't run the script yet, use screen
14:26  velcroshooz| hatten, or the wiki
14:26  Stalafin| grawity: also, what is the purpose of first stating ssh-agent -s; the stuf which is exported there, what is the purpose?
14:26  hatten| scp1: lol, I cannot copy-paste yet =p
14:26  grawity| Stalafin: 'ssh' needs to know where it can reach the agent -- they are separate programs after all -- so it checks an "environment variable" previously set by ssh-agent.
14:26  Mion| loonyphoenix: or nohup
14:26  Stalafin| grawity: ah, i see
14:26  scp1| hatten, lol
14:26  loonyphoenix| jason^: I want to close the terminal window :(
14:27  scp1| hatten, man screen, /scrollback /copy
14:27  grawity| Stalafin: note: do not run "ssh-agent -s"
14:27  grawity| Stalafin: Run eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" instead
14:27  Stalafin| grawity: can't i simply put ssh-agent -s into bashrc? why do i need to eval ${ssh-agent -s) ?
14:27  hatten| but I dun wanna restart irssi now! =p
14:27  grawity| hatten: retty
14:27  velcroshooz| i need to find a tiler i can run tint2 in. awesome's bar just doesnt cut it for me. and openbox cant ignore size hints, and pytyle only half works. im torn :/
14:28  scp1| hatten, or better yet, use some client that only works with text streams, like ii
14:28  scp1| !ii
14:28  phrik| ii, because irssi and weechat are bloat
14:28  gavino| lol
14:28  scp1| and then you can use standard tools to play with the text
14:28  gavino| and gnome isn't?
14:28  yitz_| netcat!
14:28  hatten| scp1: wow, cool
14:28  grawity| Stalafin: A process can modify its own environment, but not of any other processes. So ssh-agent outputs some shell commands to stdout -- and because of eval "$(foo)" they are interpreted by your shell, in order to set that $SSH_* thing.
14:28  gavino| pidgin!
14:28  gavino| I got 2200 meg rma fre!
14:28  gavino| ram
14:28  grawity| gavino: Empathy.
14:28  hatten| grawity: wow, another man page to read =D
14:28  yitz_| man pages are awesome
14:28  gavino| icewm+firefox+pidgin+archlinux
14:28  velcroshooz| yitz_, ++
14:28  grawity| aur/asr-manpages
14:28  gavino| mm
14:28  hatten| but often too long to be bothered to read
14:29  gavino| tiling is for weirdoes
14:29  Stalafin| grawity: oh, so they wouldn't be interpreted without eval?
14:29  yitz_| My aur install script offers to show me man pages after it installs a package
14:29  velcroshooz| hatten, and then there was apropos
14:29  JannoT| !ninjas
14:29  phrik| Ninjas are cool enough to use tiling WMs. Be one yourself as well!
14:29  hatten| !tiling
14:29  phrik| a window manager with an organization of the screen into mutually non-overlapping frames, as opposed to the more popular approach of coordinate-based stacking of overlapping objects (windows) that tries to fully emulate the desktop metaphor.
14:30  jason^| loonyphoenix: if it's not super critical, i'd try disown (if you're on bash) and see if it does what you want
14:30  hatten| yitz_: haha
14:30  grawity| Stalafin: Pretty much. The $() part captures a command's output, and 'eval' makes sure that output gets interpreted as commands.
14:30         * hatten punches gavino
14:30  loonyphoenix| jason^: thanks, I'll try that :)
14:31  Stalafin| grawity: cool, thank you! one last question: why would you say that $ exec /usr/bin/ssh-agent $SHELL is better than what you suggest with ssh-agent -s?
14:32  grawity| Stalafin: It has one advantage: when you close the shell window (or logout), the ssh-agent dies too. (On the other hand, it might be a disadvantage.)
14:32  jason^| loonyphoenix: i've had problems with it before, so ymmv :(
14:33  Stalafin| grawity: aaaah, alright; so now that i start the agent, give my passphrase, etc, i also need to make sure that that terminal stays open;
14:33  loonyphoenix| jason^: it actually worked :)
14:33  grawity| Stalafin: But it's only an advantage when the agent is started before running any GUI.
14:33  Stalafin| grawity: shouldn't it be possible to demonize it?
14:33  grawity| Stalafin: With eval "$(blah)" it does daemonize itself.
14:33  Stalafin| grawity: well, assuming that i frequently log out of my x?
14:33  jason^| loonyphoenix: awesome, glad it worked out
14:34  gavino| hatten: lol
14:34  gavino| dogdges hatten and throw him through window out 18th floor office tower
14:34  Stalafin| grawity: wait, the thing you suggest just makes some export stuff; if i simply call ssh-agent from bashrc, i cannot give my passphrase; so that wouldn't really work, would it?
14:34  gavino| blam!
14:34  loonyphoenix| jason^: yeah, thanks. that's a useful tool anyway :) I get stuck with lots of open terminals sometimes just for this reason...
14:34  grawity| Stalafin: Calling ssh-agent is one step. Decrypting/loading your key is another.
14:35  hatten| grawity: tiling is the best thing ever invented =p
14:35  grawity| hatten: Shut up. I'm using wmii on freakin' Windows.
14:35  scp1| MS invented tiling
14:36  velcroshooz| i think masons invented tiling.
14:36  sudokode| didn't they have some kinda cascade windows thing back in like 98 or ME?
14:36  scp1| http://www.georgehernandez.com/h/xComputers/MS/Windows1screenshot.png
14:36  gavino| tiling is silly
14:36  gavino| I liek us emouse liek on windows
14:36  gavino| why would i tile?
14:36  gavino| you have to use mouse in web broswer
14:36  scp1| no
14:36  velcroshooz| if silly means efficient, then yes
14:36  hatten| gavino: ehh, no
14:36  gavino| soner or later so fingers coming off keyboard anyhow
14:36  gavino| lol
14:36  velcroshooz| gavino, no you dont heh
14:36  gavino| sure ya do
14:36  hatten| gavino: vimperator/vimprobable/uzbl
14:36  sudokode| tiling is just a fad
14:36  scp1| wtf, yet another troll?
14:37  gavino| most sites not designed for keybaord naviagtion
14:37  gavino| sorry
14:37  hatten| no?
14:37  sudokode| people think they're cool cause it's not "bloated"
14:37  gavino| iceWM
14:37  gavino| is not tha tbloaed
14:37  grawity| Stalafin: I used to start ssh-agent from my ~/.profile (NOT ~/.bashrc), and then manually run ssh-add after getting my tea.
14:37  hatten| but 99% of the pages out there are perfectly usable with keyboard
14:37  gavino| no they arent
14:37  hatten| because?
14:37  velcroshooz| sudokode, i am not anti mouse but using all your screen space just makes sense
14:37  gavino| the tabbing from oen link to next is sadly broken on many
14:37  hatten| how can I survive without a mouse then?
14:37  gavino| then you goto mouse
14:37  gavino| where you could been all along
14:38  hoothoot| on firefox u can press '
14:38  hoothoot| and search in links only
14:38  gavino| you soemhow dont goto msot site
14:38  hatten| gavino: you don't tab to choose links, that's stupid
14:38  gavino| uh yeah goto yahoo.com
14:38  gavino| and open finance
14:38  gavino| and goto basic chart
14:38  hatten| gavino: why would i?
14:38  gavino| tell me how many time u tab
14:38  gavino| lol
14:38  hatten| gavino: fucking none
14:38  velcroshooz| people still use yahoo?
14:38  scp1| wtf...
14:38  hatten| gavino: I orient with 'fl' followed by some letters
14:38  sudokode| velcroshooz, I use all my screen space
14:39  scp1| f/F
14:39  sudokode| for the current thing I'm working on
14:39  sudokode| =\
14:39  scp1| also, ;
14:39  hatten| gavino: I don't even know what tabbing does in uzbl
14:39  gavino| ;)
14:39  scp1| (;y)
14:39  gavino| uh
14:39  gavino| hm
14:39  hatten| !hmm
14:39  phrik| indeed
14:40  gavino| simpler for me to use mouse
14:40  gavino| and in icewm i can split windows top n bottom
14:40  velcroshooz| sudokode, i normally stick to one virtual desktop per app anyway, so tiling isnt so important, but i like having one vd use it for irc + file manager + video
14:40  gavino| with mouse
14:40  gavino| no need to mmemorize codes
14:40  gavino| ;)
14:40  ksh| I, i've oss 4 installed, but kernel headers seems always work with oss 3, <linux/soundcard.h> no SNDCTL_DSP_GETPLAYVOL for example (I think something is missing on the oss package)
14:40  sudokode| ic
14:41  velcroshooz| if openbox could ignore size hints id never use anything else :/ the fact that i get edges on my urxvt kills me.
14:41  scp1| gavino, Please tell us why you should manage your windows yourself, instead of letting the window MANAGER handle them
14:41  hatten| gavino: yes, mouse is simpler
14:41  hatten| !gui
14:41  phrik| Girls Use It
14:41  eyescream| :DD
14:42  Stalafin| grawity: so: with ssh-agent -s i demonize it; then i execute ssh-add, where i am asked for my passphrase (this is where the whole thing gets decrypted); what you were referring to before with the exec /usr/bin/ssh-agent - i would need to do this way before i start X (or login, for that matter) in order for it to be of an advantage?

14:43  velcroshooz| gavino, so it comes down to being lazy is what your saying. then being efficient on the desktop isnt really a priority for you.

14:44  hatten| JannoT: in framebuffer, but in X uzbl
14:44  velcroshooz| psst. nobody uses yahoo. they had to break the bank just so ubuntu would use it as the default search engine in 10.04
14:44  scp1| gavino, and what is "basic chart"?
14:44  gavino| I might write a common lisp replacement for iceWM if I get soem time

14:46  new_bember| any errors in xorg.log?
14:47  velcroshooz| hint: wash your hands after going to the bathroom

15:00  velcroshooz| i could not cope with a crappy chair
15:00  demonicmaniac| thebloggu: unload the module
15:00  macrobat| why would one need height adjustment?
15:00  JannoT| Clearly its NSA
15:00  hatten| macrobat: to get proper height?
15:01  hatten| macrobat: this chair is way too short
15:01  velcroshooz| multiple users, multiple desks, etc etc - plus what hatten said

15:01  Mion| thebloggu: or somehting like that
15:01  macrobat| ok, i am just a lonely user on a single desk here
15:01  hatten| but we don't have chair's with appropriate height compared to this desk
15:02  Mion| velcroshooz: get a adjustable chair
15:02  LugarSivi| Hey ppl, I'm currently installing Arch on one PC, and I'm planing to go with XFS file system and LILO boot loader, will that work fine?
15:02  hatten| except if I steal an adjustable chair
15:02  hatten| LugarSivi: OMG! NO! it will asplode!
15:02  Mion| much more comfy to sit it noo
15:02  Mion| too*
15:02  Mion| if it has a gass damper
15:02  hatten| LugarSivi: why shouldn't it?
15:02  LugarSivi| can i put lilo in mbr? i was reading sth...
15:02  Huulivoide| LugarSivi: why do you want xfs and lilo
15:02  LugarSivi| idk what
15:02  LugarSivi| it was years ago lol
15:02  velcroshooz| Mion, i have one, we are talking about the benefits of having an adjustable one
15:02  Mion| why use lilo?
15:03  LugarSivi| its simpler then grub
15:03  fogobogo| LugarSivi: maybe that its dead and doesnt support the newer fs's?
15:03  Mion| LugarSivi: no?
15:03  Turski| i just installed grub2 :)
15:03  LugarSivi| its easier to fix lilo if grub brokes
15:03  Huulivoide| grub is not simple?
15:03  Mion| no?
15:03  hatten| LugarSivi: btw, I'm unsure whether the installer supports LILO
15:03  Turski| it can use my native panel resolution and pass it for kernel \o
15:03  thebloggu| mion i already tried messing with it but no luck
15:03  fogobogo| hatten: oh it does afaik
15:03  macrobat| grub2 could have some better documentation
15:04  fogobogo| then again. didnt install for quite some time
15:04  velcroshooz| long live legacy grub
15:04  hatten| fogobogo: not the newest one, the one at build.archlinux.org
15:05  fogobogo| hatten: that one does grub2?
15:05  LugarSivi| so will installer let me put lilo in mbr if I go with xfs
15:05  hatten| fogobogo: although my 09.06 have lilo =D
15:05  hatten| fogobogo: nope
15:05  fogobogo| hoothoot: oh nvm
15:05  fogobogo| err
15:05  fogobogo| hatten: ^
15:05  LugarSivi| i heard xfs needs some superblock
15:05  hatten| haha
15:05  thebloggu| my webcam turns itself on sometimes. i don't know exactly how nor when but i think it may be related to flash in some websites but i'm not sure. i would like to solve this or at least turn off the webcam. can someone help me?

15:05  sudokode| thebloggu, you don't happen to have a laptop issued to you by your high school?
15:05  fogobogo| LugarSivi: maybe
15:06  fogobogo| !give LugarSivi wikipedia xfs
15:06  phrik| LugarSivi: XFS - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFS>
15:06  thebloggu| sudokode, as a matter of fact, i dont :)
15:06  sudokode| oh, then that is strange
15:07  LugarSivi| so there isn't anyone here with XFS? So that he can tell me his experience with bootloader
15:07  hatten| LugarSivi: I got XFS, but not on /
15:07  sudokode| I had issues copying stuff on xfs, that's about all
15:08  sudokode| I stopped using it after the third kernel panic
15:08  LugarSivi| i plan to use it for both / and /home
15:08  sudokode| lol, oops
15:08  fogobogo| LugarSivi: xfs is nice for large files. so if you want to store some hd porn go for it. but usually ext is kinda better fro that
15:08  Huulivoide| I like btrfs, the sub volumes are just best
15:08  jonnor| I don't get the filesystem fuzz.
15:08  hatten| fogobogo: omg, you caught me!
15:08         * hatten is installing btrfs right now
15:09  fogobogo| hatten: shut up and link the torrent!
15:09  LugarSivi| its decided already, im going wtih xfs, don't try to suggest me anything else :DD I just need info on conflict with bootloader in mbr :)
15:09         * fogobogo wants some hd porn too
15:09  hatten| fogobogo: haha, actually I don't have any, but I was on the way to download 80GB hentai
15:09  jonnor| LugarSivi: what do you mean?
15:09  sudokode| LugarSivi, use ext2 for your /boot partition
15:09  fogobogo| hatten: also nice
15:09  MutantTurkey| hey folks o/
15:09  jonnor| Grub supports xfs. no?
15:09  sudokode| which version/
15:09  LugarSivi| jonnor: im thining to put llilo in mbr
15:10  LugarSivi| and xfs for / and /home
15:10  jonnor| grub1
15:10  MutantTurkey| LugarSivi: why not grub?>
15:10  MutantTurkey| grub1 is sex.
15:10         -!- glguy_ is now known as glguy
15:10  jonnor| grub2 probaby does also

15:10  sudokode| nvm then
15:10  phrik| Title: XFS FAQ - XFS.org (at xfs.org)
15:10  LugarSivi| coz grub is just massive fat amount of HACK
15:10  sudokode| apparently it does work now
15:10  MutantTurkey| TheMoonMaster: it is supported.
15:10  MutantTurkey| you dont need journaling on your /boot/
15:10  fogobogo| LugarSivi: grub2 much less though
15:10  FliPPeh| Why do programs like Firefox, Thunderbird and OpenOffice never respect my GTK settings?
15:10  FliPPeh| I hate it :(
15:10  jonnor| MutantTurkey: xfs is also supported
15:11  TheMoonMaster| Ah, I forgot that ext2 didn't have journaling.
15:11  sudokode| MutantTurkey, xfs is smaller than ext2
15:11  sudokode| so it really doesn't matter
15:11  yitz_| bin32-skype: the chat and whatnot works but not the audio/video. When I try placing a call, the popup window says "Problem with Audio Playback". Anyone familiar with bin32-skype?
15:11  fogobogo| FliPPeh: because you didnt restart them?
15:11  jonnor| yitz_: works-for-me, usually
15:11  FliPPeh| fogobogo: That's not it
15:11  jonnor| yitz_: are you using alsa?
15:11  Huulivoide| qyitz_: what audioo back end are you using in skype
15:11  MutantTurkey| sudokode: i dont care.
15:11  MutantTurkey| ext2 is defalt.
15:11  fogobogo| FliPPeh: there support for that. but tht usually means to install gnoome
15:11  yitz_| oss
15:11  sudokode| default what?
15:11  hatten| Huulivoide: for converting an installation to btrfs, is this all: 1. Convert the partition. 2. edit fstab 3. add module in rc.conf
15:11  MutantTurkey| everything is about president
15:12  yitz_| I added oss-alsa
15:12  wonder| FliPPeh, works for me
15:12  sudokode| I'm confused!
15:12  FliPPeh| wonder: It does work a bit, but there's some details missing
15:12  hatten| Huulivoide: or do you need to also install btrfs-progs-unstable?
15:12  MutantTurkey| i use ext2 for boot because i always have, and alot of other people do.
15:12  FliPPeh| Like proper highlighting
15:12  wonder| FliPPeh, even respect the icon them
15:12  wonder| *theme
15:12         * hatten uses ext2 for boot
15:12  fogobogo| sudokode: you are me. without the ponies on the sailboat
15:12  sudokode| I use ext2 for boot as well
15:12  Huulivoide| hatten: I have git version of the progs, and I havent converted my install, iahve just formated my nearly new 1Tb hd whit it
15:13  sudokode| xfs is a piece of shit, in my eyes
15:13  LugarSivi| ok i got my solution, xfs works with lilo if lilo is in the MBR and not in /
15:13  MutantTurkey| is it.
15:13  sudokode| lol, I'm just saying, if you wanted, you can use xfs for /boot
15:13  MutantTurkey| a smelly stinking pile of poop
15:13  hatten| Huulivoide: oh ok, but does it look like something is missing?

15:13  |ast|| btrfs rulez!!
15:13  MutantTurkey| s/window\ managers/file\ systems

15:13  sudokode| lolll
15:14         * fogobogo is a sissy and wants journaling for his /boot. thus ext3
15:14  Huulivoide| hatten: to me,no. but I dont think you need enytinh rc.conf, but adding btrfs to /etc/mkinitcpio.conf wont do anybad
15:14  sudokode| what
15:14  MutantTurkey| fogobogo: and theres nothing wrong with that. all the ExtX's are good
15:14  sudokode| why ext3 on your /boot
15:14  MutantTurkey| why not?
15:14  MutantTurkey| why have 8 gigs of ram? WHY NOT
15:14  sudokode| lolwtf
15:14  hatten| Huulivoide: don't you add modules in rc.conf? or can one do both?
15:14  velcroshooz| why even bother with a seperare boot if your not on a mission critical machine? point is there is different setups for everyones needs.
15:15  JannoT| Clearly its NSA
15:15  JavaAtom| MutantTurkey: I have a hard enough time dealing with 4GB of ram.
15:15  JavaAtom| MutantTurkey: No idea what I'd be doing with 8 on a regular basis.
15:15         * hatten got 4GB of ram and 32bit =D
15:15  Huulivoide| hatten: I do add some modules to rc.conf, but filysystem modules need to be loaded at boot time, so thoy need to go to mkinitcpio.conf
15:15  jonnor| hatten: modules in rc.conf are loaded when the ordinary rootfs is up
15:15  sudokode| hatten, same
15:15  FrankDrebin| JavaAtom: open up tons of pdfs
15:15         * JavaAtom smacks hatten.
15:15  hatten| JavaAtom: it's a 32bit CPU!
15:15  JavaAtom| FrankDrebin: But I run xpdf. Doesn't exactly scream "eat my memory" you know.
15:16  sudokode| mine's an athlon64 X2 :>
15:16  jonnor| hatten: so if you need a module to get the ordinary rootfs up, putting it in rc.conf wont help you
15:16  FrankDrebin| JavaAtom: so do i, but when i have 5 of em open, bye bye to my 1GB memory
15:16  hatten| jonnor: okay
15:16  JavaAtom| hatten: Dear lord... if it's not a netbook, there's something wrong there.
15:16  jonnor| Also, in most cases you do not need to explicity load modules.
15:16  JavaAtom| FrankDrebin: That's rather surprising. I mean, I guess it shouldn't be, but meh.
15:16  sudokode| yeah, if you have an initrd
15:16  hatten| but how can mkinitcpio be read when the filesystem cannot be read?
15:17  FrankDrebin| JavaAtom: I am terrible with pdfs, i have 900 page books :P
15:17  JavaAtom| FrankDrebin: That'll do it.
15:17  sudokode| why does mkinitcpio have to be called?
15:17  Pingfloyd| hatten: your bootloader loads it into ram
15:17  jonnor| hatten: it cannot
15:17  sudokode| o.o
15:17  Huulivoide| hatten; you edit mkinitcpio.conf, rebuild initrd image grub loads initrd to ram and kernel reads initrd
15:17  FrankDrebin| monolithic kernel ftw!
15:18  hatten| Huulivoide: aha then I understand
15:18  JavaAtom| giant kernel of doom?
15:18  jonnor| hatten: before the ordinary rootfs is up, the kernel uses a temporary roofs, which is in the kernel26.img ;)
15:18  sudokode| lolll
15:18  jonnor| which is generated by mkinitcpio
15:18  hatten| btw, btrfs should be added to modules and not hooks, right?
15:18  FrankDrebin| i never understood why the kenel developers added to option to generate a random config
15:18  Huulivoide| it can alsobe named other than kernel26.img, if you use custom kernel
15:18  Huulivoide| yes to modules
15:19  sudokode| lol.. you kids and your initrd's
15:19  hatten| So I need to chroot and rebuild initrd?
15:19  jonnor| hatten: don't you have the system running now?
15:19  Pingfloyd| hatten: the general idea with initrds is that they load up the needed modules support and provide a temporary root fs in ram in order to get to the point where enough support is loaded to bring up the real root fs.
15:19  Huulivoide| mkinitcpio -p kernel26
15:19  sudokode| make menuconfig and be happy
15:19  hatten| jonnor: I'm on a liveusb
15:19  FrankDrebin| hatten: you can just copy the file
15:19  FrankDrebin| no need for chroot
15:19  hatten| FrankDrebin: oh ok
15:19  FrankDrebin| make sure it doesnt overwrite your current one
15:19  jonnor| FrankDrebin: no, not really
15:19  Pingfloyd| sudokode: what do you have against initrd
15:19  sudokode| holy shit, it's monday
15:20  sudokode| where did my weekend go..
15:20  FrankDrebin| sudokode: forgot to go to work?
15:20  sudokode| no, just surprised
15:20  jonnor| hatten: do a chroot unless you know your kernel and early init setups are the same
15:20  MutantTurkey| sudokode: i've been asking myself that question ALL DAY
15:20  hatten| jonnor: so I need to chroot and cannot just copy the file?
15:20  sudokode| thought it was sunday
15:20  hatten| jonnor: oh ok
15:20  HokieTux| hey all - found a file that I can't delete, and I have no idea what it is. wtf is the 's' at the start, and how do I delete this thing?  srw-r--r-- 1 daedalus   0 Apr 15 15:02 dd=
15:20  hatten| I don't know chroot especially well either, so wish me luck
15:20  jonnor| hatten: you might be able to do it succesfully without a chroot, and you migth not be.
15:20  HokieTux| also, pretty sure it isn't a rootkit - ran chkrootkit on it, and the logs don't indicate anything scary
15:20  sudokode| Pingfloyd, I don't like to depend on something to load stuff for me, nor do I like useless modules and compiling/installing a bunch of useless modules
15:21  jonnor| Its documented on the wiki, not a lot of stress.
15:21  hatten| oh
15:21  sudokode| hence why I compile the kernel with what I need and don't use an initd
15:21  HokieTux| the name of the file is 'dd=' - I can't run commands on it
15:21  sudokode| initrd even
15:21  MutantTurkey| HokieTux: isnt that a pipe flag?
15:21  Pingfloyd| sudokode: that must be a real joy when you're deploying to multiple systems
15:21  HokieTux| MutantTurkey: I thought pipe was 'p'?
15:21  HokieTux| maybe I'm wrong
15:21  jonnor| sudokode: then you cant use LVM :(
15:21  FrankDrebin| hatten: sorry i am not quite sure what you are trying to do but you can use mkinitcpio -g to specify a different kernel to the one you are running
15:21  sudokode| I don't deploy multiple systems
15:21  MutantTurkey| HokieTux: wait hmmm
15:21  sudokode| I don't use LVM
15:21  MutantTurkey| srw-r--r--   1 root     sys            0 Apr  1 07:50 semaphore
15:21  MutantTurkey| whatever that is
15:22  HokieTux| hm
15:22  hatten| isn't it simply "chroot /dev/sda2;mount /boot;mkinitcpio -p kernel26"
15:22  sudokode| initrd is useful when you change hardware enough
15:22  HokieTux| okay, maybe you are right
15:22  jonnor| hatten: no
15:22  hatten| oh no
15:22  HokieTux| well, this one definitely shouldn't be here... I think the real problem is that the file name is dd=
15:22  HokieTux| so I can't run commands on it
15:22  hatten| I mean
15:22  jonnor| hatten: read the wiki
15:22  MutantTurkey| HokieTux: well rm it
15:22  HokieTux| how do you run a command on a filename that shoudn't exist
15:22  hatten| nvm, ok
15:22  HokieTux| can't
15:22  Pingfloyd| sudokode: I think it's rather myopic to imply that a static kernel is the only way to go
15:22  MutantTurkey| as root?
15:22  sudokode| I didn't say that
15:22  HokieTux| it says that the file doesn't exist
15:22  HokieTux| yup
15:22  HokieTux| rm: cannot remove `dd=': No such file or directory
15:23  Huulivoide| rm dd? <- try that
15:23  sudokode| it's arguable though that using an initrd when it's not needed is just another possible source of problems
15:23  HokieTux| Huulivoide: it worked!!!
15:23  HokieTux| you win, sir
15:23  HokieTux| thanks so much =)
15:23  FrankDrebin| sudokode: it saves most people compiling their own kernel
15:24  sudokode| well, you still have to compile a kernel... along with all the modules
15:24  Pingfloyd| sudokode: so is making everything static.  e.g. when your alsa drivers take a dump
15:24  MutantTurkey| !next
15:24  phrik| Another satisfied customer! NEXT!
15:24  HokieTux| thanks so much MutantTurkey  and Huulivoide =)
15:24  sudokode| Pingfloyd, my alsa drivers are modules
15:24  sudokode| :)
15:24  jonnor| sudokode: compiling your own, custom, kernel is arguably a bigger risk when it comes to problems
15:24  FrankDrebin| my alsa drivers are built in :(
15:24  sudokode| jonnor, that is true, it can be easier.. I'd recommend genkernel though
15:24  DefunctProcess| compiling custom kernels is usually unnecessary
15:25  Pingfloyd| DefunctProcess: yeah
15:25  hatten| jonnor: hmm, (halfway through the wiki article), cannot I just boot the fallback image and then rebuild it?
15:25  Pingfloyd| DefunctProcess: any more I only bother if there is a problem
15:25  sudokode| but anyway =\
15:25  Huulivoide| hatten: if the fall back has btrfs
15:25  FrankDrebin| where is the old hacker spirit gone?
15:26  sudokode| FrankDrebin, exactly!
15:26  jonnor| hatten: if you can boot your ordinary system in any way, then yes, just boot it and rebuild the initrd
15:26  hatten| Huulivoide: how do I check that?
15:26  garrik| hi, has anyone tried nilfs as / filesystem?
15:26  jonnor| garrik: just state your real question/problem
15:27  Huulivoide| hatten: if you dont have nay fishy setups, it hink all the filysytem drivers are in initrd by default
15:27  Huulivoide| hatten: =)
15:27  hatten| Huulivoide: it's up to date, and default so it should have
15:27         * hatten rebootsss

15:57  demonicmaniac| perhaps drog or drap ?

16:35  wonder| elaich, now to be seriously, if you want arch, you might want to check alternatives
16:35  VirtualDisaster| i wonder why
16:35  wonder| distro based on arch

16:36  wonder| has kde
16:36  VirtualDisaster| chakra has made kde useable
16:36  VirtualDisaster| others kde are ok notably mandriva but kde in general just isnt the same ....
16:36  wonder| chakra is arch with a kde desktop ready
16:37  VirtualDisaster| yeah but its modula
16:37  VirtualDisaster| r
16:37  VirtualDisaster| like arch
16:37  wonder| yep
16:37  VirtualDisaster| not all bloated out of the box
16:37  VirtualDisaster| but kde4's stuff like akondi kill me
16:37  VirtualDisaster| requires mysql seriously....

16:49  intgr| I'm trying to build Firefox on Arch and get this: nsPNGEncoder.cpp:138: error: ‘png_voidp_NULL’ was not declared in this scope
16:49  intgr| According to Google it was mentioned in the firefox-pgo-bega AUR package, but Arch geniuses deleted all the comments
16:49  wonder| intgr, check out xulrunner patch for libpng14
16:50  wonder| intgr, like a side note, what version are you trying to build?
16:50  intgr| Ahh, it's in xulrunner not firefox? Explains why I didn't find it.
16:50  intgr| 2.6.3plugin1
16:50  intgr| 3.6.3plugin1
16:50  wonder| ok
16:51  wonder| i built that myself
16:51  davekong| Could the version of java I am running cause a website to not render? Like because I am using openjdk and not the proprietary version?
16:51  linduxed| so i've got ntp installed and i was told that it adjusts the time automatically
16:51  linduxed| apparently it does so on boot but never else instead
16:51  linduxed| or so i'm told
16:51  intgr| davekong: Shouldn't affect the rest of the web page.
16:51  VirtualDisaster| wonder, you know how to create pkgs for arch
16:51  linduxed| but in my case it doesn't even do that
16:51  VirtualDisaster| like pkgbuilds and such
16:51  wonder| VirtualDisaster, no!
16:51  VirtualDisaster| oh i was about to be like wtf you can actually do that ....
16:51  VirtualDisaster| you as in you
16:52  linduxed| the only way for me to have it work is to drop a script into /etc/cron.hourly that says "ntpd -s"
16:52  wonder| VirtualDisaster, whois me :)
16:52  fogobogo| wonder: you are uhm.... a horse?
16:52  linduxed| that spawns a ntpd -s process every hour, but it did keep the time right
16:52  Pingfloyd| VirtualDisaster: a little early to be drunk, wouldn't you say
16:52  wonder| fogobogo, a geek
16:53  linduxed| then i was told i didn't need this, but lo' and behold, when i removed the script, my time is all messed up
16:53  VirtualDisaster| Pingfloyd, how so am i drunk?
16:53  fogobogo| oh. thats cool too. i like greeks .
16:53  VirtualDisaster| linduxed, ntpdate not woroking for you
16:53  linduxed| VirtualDisaster: i don't have that command
16:53  linduxed| i've only got ntpd
16:53  VirtualDisaster| linduxed, install it
16:53  VirtualDisaster| clyde -S ntpdate
16:53  velcroshooz| linduxed, check what hardwareclock is set to in rc.conf as well
16:53  VirtualDisaster| i mean pacman -S ntpdate ....
16:54  linduxed| velcroshooz: it's set to what i need to have
16:54  novotny| hi
16:55  novotny| is possible have nvidia, and ati cards in system ?
16:55  linduxed| VirtualDisaster: there is no such package
16:55  velcroshooz| i use openntpd personally, so dont know much about ntp errors
16:55  novotny| :: nvidia-96xx-utils conflicts with libgl. Remove libgl? [Y/n]
16:55  VirtualDisaster| linduxed, hmm i use clyde so youll have to get it from aur
16:55  novotny| is possible to have both packages on system at one time ?
16:55  DigitalKiwi| aur/ntpdate 4.2.6-1 (177) client for the network time protocol
16:55  wonder| linduxed, ntpdate is a part of ntp package
16:56  VirtualDisaster| wonder, then why is it not in default install
16:56  VirtualDisaster| kinda made me wonder that as well
16:56  wonder| VirtualDisaster, ntp?
16:56  linduxed| wonder: then why haven't i got the command?
16:56  VirtualDisaster| no ntpdate
16:56  VirtualDisaster| i had to install it from aur as well
16:56  linduxed| VirtualDisaster: ntpdate conflicts with ntp
16:57  VirtualDisaster| hmm i didnt install ntp
16:57  wonder| linduxed, maybe you didn't see it
16:57  Blaargh| openntpd has no ntpdate
16:57  wonder| but is in NTP package
16:57  velcroshooz| /usr/bin/ntpdate is owned by ntp 4.2.6-3
16:57  Blaargh| it uses the -s switch
16:57  wonder| ntp != openntpd
16:57  linduxed| maybe it's because i use openntpd
16:57  linduxed| ill check
16:59  novotny| :: nvidia-96xx-utils conflicts with libgl. Remove libgl? [Y/n]
16:59  novotny| is possible to have both packages on system at one time ?

16:59  wonder| novotny, no
16:59  novotny| but one card is nvidia, and second some old pci ati
17:00  novotny| Blaargh: ^^
17:00  wonder| there is a script in forum that can handle multi cards
17:00  fogobogo| wonder: multi card what? pokemon?
17:00  DigitalKiwi| VirtualDisaster: because you don't have 'ntp' installed ;p

17:02  VirtualDisaster| holy crap
17:02  wonder| novotny, to be fair, i don't remember in what forum is. try searching for multi drivers

10:54  xtraeme| MrElendig: if this causes a kernel panic, I'd call it a bug in the kernel :-)
10:54  MrElendig| EmoSpice: it being Required by: xf86-video-nouveau   should have given you a big hint
10:54  MrElendig| :p
10:55  EmoSpice| MrElendig: well, I had it installed and read through the wiki - which states that it's no longer required - but yes, you're right.
10:55  EmoSpice| I'm compiling libdrm-git now followed by nouveau-git
10:55  MrElendig| fix the wiki
10:56  EmoSpice| As soon as I get back into X, I'll work on that
10:56  MrElendig| well, the -git stuff might be differenty
10:56  MrElendig| different*
10:56  MrElendig| but you never said you were using the devel tree :)
10:57  EmoSpice| MrElendig: I didn't particularly want to use the dev versions, but since I have to rebuild anyway I might as well
10:58  VCoolio| MrElendig: what's wrong with redirecting output like 1<>/dev/pts/?  (considering pokraka's question)
10:58         * MrElendig would just use the non-free drivers
10:58  MrElendig| VCoolio: except that it doesn't work?
10:58  EmoSpice| I was - the problem is that TwinView is a piece of crap
10:58  MrElendig| nha
10:58  MrElendig| twinview is nice
10:59  MrElendig| the only problem with it is if you are using multiple cards
10:59  MrElendig| but support for that will come with femri :)

11:00  Beyecixramd| hi people, i tried to install Arch Linux on my dell mini 10v, but it says "device didn't show after 30 seconds, and then it throws me into a shell (not the one with the login stuff, and all that, just a shell with all modules loaded until then...) i think it's because arch unmounts the USB key, and loses "connection"
11:01  MrElendig| Beyecixramd: is this in the installer?
11:01  Beyecixramd| before even reaching the login screen, MrElendig
11:01  MrElendig| Beyecixramd: try one of the new images
11:01  Beyecixramd| it's the latest one
11:02  Beyecixramd| used unetbootin to install it to my usb key
11:02  MrElendig| don't say "latest"
11:02  Beyecixramd| why MrElendig?
11:02  MrElendig| because what you call "latest" might not actually be the latest
11:02  MrElendig| also, unetbootin is not always reliable
11:02  Beyecixramd| it is the latest, 2009.8
11:02  MrElendig| and arch do provides usb images
11:02  MrElendig| Beyecixramd: that is not the latest
11:02  Beyecixramd| okay, downloading usb image now
11:03  Beyecixramd| 10 minutes ago, it was..
11:03  MrElendig| the .iso was never ment to be used on a usb
11:03  MrElendig| http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=95503   http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=94687
11:03  phrik| Title: Arch Linux Forums / 2010.04-1 archboot "2k10-R3" ISO hybrid image released (at bbs.archlinux.org)
11:03  MrElendig| try one of those
11:03  MrElendig| generally prefered over 2009.08
11:03  EmoSpice| Beyecixramd: I've had a LOT of problems with unetbootin and Arch
11:03  Beyecixramd| oh hmm...
11:03  EmoSpice| use the .IMG and flashnul if you're coming from windows
11:03  Beyecixramd| but why that versioon isn't here? http://www.archlinux.org/download/
11:03  phrik| Title: Arch Linux (at www.archlinux.org)
11:04  Beyecixramd| EmoSpice: win... what? what's that? xD
11:04  MrElendig| they got newer kernels, support for more wifi devices, a more updated pacman that actually works with .xz packages
11:04  MrElendig| Beyecixramd: because they are not "official" yet
11:04  EmoSpice| Beyecixramd: if you're coming from Linux, use dd then ;)
11:04  PingFloyd| good to see it support .xz
11:05  Beyecixramd| MrElendig: will that work with http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dell_Mini_10v#Hardware ?

11:06  Beyecixramd| btw, i heard that BrTFS (or however it is called) is better for SSDs, is that right? or what's the best filesystem to avoid delays and excessive writings to the SSD then?
11:06  MrElendig| the wifi might be troublesome during install, everything else should work fine
11:06  MrElendig| the archboot images have full support for brtfs
11:07  Beyecixramd| MrElendig: i know, but what's the best suited filesystem for a netbok with an SSD drive?
11:07  MrElendig| the test images don't have the brtfs tools, but they can be grabbed by pacman -S
11:07  MrElendig| Beyecixramd: it's  more about how you tweak the filesystem than the filesystem itself
11:07  Dekko| testing
11:07  EmoSpice| Beyecixramd: anything unjournaled is better than anything journaled. so Ext2 works relatively well as does btrfs but btrfs is still relatively unstable fwir
11:08  MrElendig| not to mention logging and so on
11:08  MrElendig| EmoSpice: nha
11:08  MrElendig| EmoSpice: journal have more advantages than disadvantages
11:08  MrElendig| journaling*
11:08  Beyecixramd| MrElendig: not for SSDs afaik
11:08  ape| 'gdm-control --shutdown' says "Failed to establish a connection with GDM: No such file or directory". I am running GDM. Why doesn't it work?
11:08  MrElendig| Beyecixramd: nope, still better
11:08  Jonimus| ^
11:09  MrElendig| Beyecixramd: you can tweak the fs to not do too many extra writes
11:09  MrElendig| and journaling will help you when the battery runs out and your system goes down uncleanly
11:09  EmoSpice| MrElendig: I can agree with that, but they significantly increase the writes to an SSD. With the long battery life and some common sense, I'd rather use an unjournaled system
11:09  MrElendig| and brtfs isn't really about speed, but functinality
11:09  Beyecixramd| MrElendig: thats true...
11:10  MrElendig| if you are paranoid about extra writes tho, use nilfs2
11:10  Beyecixramd| MrElendig: ill investigate that, thanks :)
11:10  MrElendig| or better, don't get a stupid ssd at all, get a raw flash device and use ubifs instead
11:10  MrElendig| :)
11:11  Sagan| o.o ssd is this for fast boot or something
11:11  MrElendig| simuilating a block device only does 2 things: makes it slower, makes it more expensive
11:11  EmoSpice| I just made sure I bought a netbook with a normal, platter hdd
11:11  MrElendig| :)
11:11  pokraka| hi again, I was the guy who wanted to redirect tty1 to tty7
11:11  pokraka| but actually I'm not sure that it is what I want to do so I will reformulate my question
11:11  pokraka| actually I simply want to see what is printed on the ctrl+alt+F1 screen from a terminal in my window manager
11:11  Beyecixramd| Sagan: no, SSD is like a big USB key, but in hard drive form
11:11  Sagan| oh dear, I need to get out of the cave

11:11  phrik| Title: Memory Technology Device (MTD) Subsystem for Linux. (at www.linux-mtd.infradead.org)
11:12  MrElendig| pd: symlink, -Syu, remove the symlink
11:12  MrElendig| pd: lots of threads about it on the bbs
11:12  pd| so libssl.so.0.9.8 is still the one in /usr/lib, so i've nothing to symlink afaict
11:12  Beyecixramd| MrElendig: block device?
11:12  MrElendig| pd: if you don't have a libssl.so at all, then you can use the install cd

11:13  MrElendig| :p
11:13  hatten| for the lose?
11:14  MrElendig| pd: grab archboot or the test image, boot it, mount your partions under /mnt, pacman -r /mnt -Syu
11:14         -!- militant_ is now known as militant
11:14  oldmerovingian| Can anyone tell me why update-grub from inside Ubuntu will find Arch, but not the lts kernel?
11:14  MrElendig| pd: might have to -S openssl explicitly too tho
11:14  pd| MrElendig: ty much, will give that a shot
11:14  MrElendig| oldmerovingian: because update-grub is a horrible crappy tool
11:14  Beyecixramd| btw, MrElendig, nilfs2 looks like very bloated, and i only got 8 Gbs on my nettop...
11:14  MrElendig| oldmerovingian: just edit menu.lst or the grub2 config yourself
11:14  oldmerovingian| MrElendig: lol.
11:15  MrElendig| oldmerovingian: it keeps actuall configuration data in comments ffs
11:15  oldmerovingian| MrElendig: The problem is Ubuntu does everything for you, and every time I change the file, it gets changed back when I do an update
11:15  MrElendig| :D
11:15  hatten| oldmerovingian: why are you using ubuntu?
11:15  VCoolio| oldmerovingian: edit /etc/default/grub, not the grub.cfg elsewhere
11:16  MrElendig| oldmerovingian: you can take the arch entry, copy it and just trow "-lts" on as needed
11:16  oldmerovingian| hatten: Trying to find the reason for a kernel panic in Arch.  We think it may be ath9k
11:16  MrElendig| notably on the kernel and initrd lines
11:16  oldmerovingian| VCoolio: Thanks, I will do that
11:16  oldmerovingian| MrElendig: That makes it easy
11:17  Beyecixramd| hmmm...
11:17  Beyecixramd| can i also, uncompress the .img USB image and drag it into my USB drive?
11:17  Beyecixramd| instead of issuing dd
11:18  MrElendig| oldmerovingian: the easiet way to find out if it is ath9k, is to simply not load it and see if it still panics, if not, load it and see if it do panic
11:18  MrElendig| Beyecixramd: no
11:18  Beyecixramd| why not, MrElendig?
11:18  MrElendig| Beyecixramd: simply because that won't work
11:18  oldmerovingian| MrElendig: Thats going to be the next step.  However, I always use wireless so I have to dig out my ethernet cord
11:18  Beyecixramd| okat MrElendig
11:18  MrElendig| Beyecixramd: the .img contains several filesystems and a partion table
11:18  Beyecixramd| okay*
11:19  Beyecixramd| ooooh... that makes sense... didn't know there could be partitions in an image :S
11:19  MrElendig| Beyecixramd: dd if=/path/to/usb.img of=/dev/sdc   replace sdc with the actuall device the usb stick gets assigned
11:19  MrElendig| do not dd it to sdc1 or similar
11:20  MrElendig| you will orfcourse lose all previous data on the stick
11:20  MrElendig| so backup anything you want to keep
11:20  Beyecixramd| dw MrElendig, i did read how to copy the usb image to a usb pendrive, but thank you anyway :)
11:20  MrElendig| and when you are done, you can simply cfdisk/mkfs to get the usb stick back to the original state
11:22  Beyecixramd| hmm MrElendig...
11:22  Beyecixramd| Fedora mounts automatically my pendrive in /media/label, is that right?
11:22  Beyecixramd| or do i have to use the /dev/* path?
11:24  u42p| any idea how i get awk to output non buffered lines? -u did not work
11:25  Beyecixramd| MrElendig: auto answered: /media/label/won't work :)
11:25  MrElendig| make sure it's not mounted
11:26  MrElendig| and you have to use the /dev/sdwhatever
11:27  gnubien| u42p: awk '{for(i=1;i<=NF;++i) printf "%s ", $i;print ""}' filename  or awk '{for(i=1;i<=NF;++i) printf "%s ", $i}' filename
11:28  u42p| gnubien: oh dear, are you sure there is no easier way? i am using it in a pipe
11:28  Beyecixramd| MrElendig: do i have to run dd as root?
11:29  gnubien| u42p: awk '/regex for the line/{for(i=1;i<=NF;++i) printf "%s ", $i}' filename
11:29  u42p| heh, ok
11:29  u42p| thanks
11:29  MrElendig| Beyecixramd: unless your user have write access to the device, yes
11:29  MrElendig| short story: yes
11:29  Beyecixramd| okay xD, done
11:29  Beyecixramd| going to boot the USB key now
11:29  gnubien| u42p: awk '/regex for the line/{printf "%s ", $i}' filename
11:30  gnubien| oops

11:38  MrElendig| that info might not be up to date
11:39  MrElendig| those are just filesystem tweaks btw, not patches
11:39  Beyecixramd| MrElendig: that's why i quoted "patches"
11:39  MrElendig| you might not want to keep your pacman log on a tmpfs
11:39  MrElendig| but you can change the location of it in pacman.conf
11:40  MrElendig| so you could always put /var/log on a tmpfs

11:40  MrElendig| how much ram do you have in it?
11:40  MrElendig| papul|offline: please don't use public away
11:42  Beyecixramd| MrElendig: 1 Gb, and by the way, should i separate /boot, /home, /var, etc, etc?
11:42  Jonimus| how would I test if IPv6 works on my LAN, is there a way to have Ping use ipv6?
11:42  MrElendig| just /home
11:42  Beyecixramd| because i only have 8 Gb...
11:42  p3nguin| ping6
11:42  Beyecixramd| MrElendig: /home and /?
11:42  MrElendig| or just have a single /
11:42  Beyecixramd| yep, that's what i mean
11:43  Jonimus| p3nguin: hmm thanks, but now I get an unknown host error...
11:43  MrElendig| Jonimus: ping an ipv6 adresss?
11:43  p3nguin| jonimus: What have you done so far to bring up the ipv6 network?
11:44  hatten| Beyecixramd: if you only have 8GB i would suggest only /
11:44  Beyecixramd| thanks hatten, will do
11:44  fogobogo| p3nguin: i worry more what my router will do to bring up ipv6
11:44  hatten| Beyecixramd: maybe also swap if you need it
11:45  Jonimus| p3nguin: i started my routers radvd and both of my boxes appear to have IPv6 addresses
11:45  p3nguin| jonimus: Are you trying to use it locally only, or over the internet?
11:45  Jonimus| locally
11:45  Jonimus| because my cable modem doesn't support it
11:45  Jonimus| I just want to test it out, mainly for learning
11:45  p3nguin| jonimus: Make sure your hosts have the ipv6 stack loaded be using  ping6 -c3 ::1
11:46  Beyecixramd| hatten: is worth the speed and lower power consumption of SSD over HDDs, having in mind SSD fail "sooner"?
11:46  Beyecixramd| hatten: talking about placed in a netbook, obviously
11:46  Jonimus| p3nguin: yeah that worked
11:46  p3nguin| jonimus: Then use ifconfig to view the inet6 addr for your NIC.
11:47  hatten| Beyecixramd: I have no clue, I've never owned an SSD
11:47  hatten| Beyecixramd: it depends what you value, if you have heaps of money you obviously want the best
11:47  Jonimus| p3nguin: done that, if I copy and paste that it gives me an unknown host.
11:47  Beyecixramd| hatten: well, SSD are also more expensive...
11:48  p3nguin| jonimus: You may see one starting with fe80, and that's a local one... ping6 that address to, just for the sake of being thorough.
11:48  p3nguin| too, rather
11:48  Jonimus| ok so if I only see the one starting with fe80 then I didn't receive one from the router?
11:48  hatten| Beyecixramd: as I said it, if you have money to spend, and want to spend it, then spend it
11:49  Beyecixramd| hatten: that means HDDs won :)
11:49  p3nguin| jonimus: Did you configure the router with a subnet to advertise?  If yes, what subnet did you use?
11:50  Jonimus| p3nguin: I did nothing other than enable it, let me look at the DD-wrt page and see what it says about configuration
11:50  p3nguin| jonimus: For local only, you don't even need to advertise a subnet -- all hosts can autoconfigure their own fe80 addresses, which you should be able to use on the LAN.

11:53  hatten| Beyecixramd: just make sure you backup, and I bet google has heaps of tips for partitioning SSD's if you want
11:54  p3nguin| jonimus: If the link local addresses are not working on the LAN, configure an appropriate subnet in your router in which to advertise to the hosts on the LAN.

11:55  LugarSivi| Hey people what would be good way of saving all conf files that are setup at installation so I can use them when I'm (re)installing arch on other PC
11:55  LugarSivi| or on same PC
11:55  p3nguin| jonimus: If you want to use IPv6 over the internet, get yourself a tunnel from tunnelbroker.net and they will assign you a routable IPv6 subnet.
11:56  LugarSivi| want to reinstall arch but preserve my conf files somehow, possible?
11:57  oskude| LugarSivi, normally all your config files are in your home dir. so normally copying that would be enough...
11:57  JannoT| Why do you need to reinstall arch? O_o
11:57  LugarSivi| they aren't
11:57  oskude| LugarSivi, and normally system config is in /etc
11:57  LugarSivi| its in /etc/
11:57  hatten| in order to create a btrfs filesystem (on all of the disk), I have to create a partition in cfdisk first, right?
11:57  oskude| LugarSivi, thats system, not yours (the user)
11:57  LugarSivi| JannoT: its complicated, but i must
11:57  Jonimus| p3nguin: ok now that I configured my router how can I tell my comps to get the new IP?
11:57  Sagan| what does IPv6 have over the IPv4
11:57  JannoT| Okey then
11:57  LugarSivi| im asking for systems

11:58  phrik| Title: Pacnew and Pacsave Files - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
11:59  p3nguin| jonimus: If you are advertising the subnet, the hosts will, hopefully, auto-configure the subnet.
11:59  LugarSivi| wget should work ?
11:59  PingFloyd| LugarSivi: installer may handle things differently though for all I know
12:00  oskude| LugarSivi, i dont see why wget should not work. but rsync could be more suitable
12:00  k0sh| what is perl equivalent of php's print_r ?
12:01  Beyecixramd| what's ext4 on cfdisk? "Linux filesystem"?
12:02  oskude| Beyecixramd, yup. (and no)
12:02  Beyecixramd| then how do i format as ext4?
12:02  oskude| Beyecixramd, thats the key, cfdisk doesnt format
12:02  Beyecixramd| oskude: .. oooh...kay... thanks
12:02  MrElendig| Beyecixramd: cfdisk has nothing to do with the filesystem at all
12:03  MrElendig| you want type 82/83 as needed, and the actuall formating is done in the next step in the installer

12:09         -!- papul is now known as papul|offline
12:10  oskude| MrElendig, if it doesnt have anything to do with the filesystem, i wonder why do you need to choose a FS type in cfdisk
12:12  MrElendig| oskude: you don't chose the filesystem
12:12  MrElendig| oskude: you chose the partion type
12:12  MrElendig| that is not the same thing
12:13  oskude| ok, but it does say "FS Type" ;P
12:14  MrElendig| that's a bad wording from the bad old days
12:14  oskude| and in cfdisk "Partition Type" seems primary/ligical
12:15  MrElendig| even if you select type 0B, that doesn't mean that you can mount it as a fat32 partion
12:15  oskude| well, Filesystem Type seems ok
12:15  MrElendig| because it won't actually have a filesystem on it
12:15  MrElendig| the partion will just have it's identifier set to 0B

13:29  timofonic| amir_varasteh: Instead a layer on top of pacman like yaourt, it's a nice app with the extra stuff itself
13:29  amir_varasteh| timofonic: so , next time i should use " clyde [packagename] " , yea ??
13:29  timofonic| falconindy: yes, it's weird haha
13:29  falconindy| its not weird
13:29  timofonic| amir_varasteh: For example
13:29  d_garbage| also man clyde
13:30  timofonic| amir_varasteh: Same commands than pacman and yaourt, plus some extra ones I think to remember
13:30  falconindy| pacman's just a front end to libalpm. it wasn't always the case, though, and they're still packaged together
13:30  amir_varasteh| wow
13:30  timofonic| amir_varasteh: I like the responsiveness of it, and able to say the dev about the bugs haha
13:31  ars1| MrElendig: i currently dont have xorg.conf maybe this is problem ?
13:31  militant| hmmm export BROWSER=/usr/bin/chromium doesn't seem to fix my default browser issue in gnome-terminal
13:31  timofonic| amir_varasteh: yaourt is slow as hell, specially in certain tasks :P
13:31  amir_varasteh| Ok , so i use "clyde fretsonfire" ... is it right ?
13:31  MrElendig| ars1: might, if your screen isn't giving out the correct edid info
13:31  timofonic| amir_varasteh: yep, or clyde -S freetsonfire
13:31  hatten| How many of the default daemons can be backgrounded? (syslog-ng network netfs crond) ?
13:31  timofonic| amir_varasteh: of "clyde -Suy"
13:31  amir_varasteh| great !!!
13:31  amir_varasteh| tanQ
13:32  timofonic| amir_varasteh: or "clude -R whateverpackage"
13:32  timofonic| amir_varasteh: or...
13:32  d_garbage| or man clyde? :)
13:32  falconindy| hatten: you wouldn't want to background network and netfs... netfs probably would fail in that case
13:32  timofonic| d_garbage: that too
13:32  timofonic| amir_varasteh: If you know how to use pacman/yaourt properly, no probs with Clyde
13:32  hatten| falconindy: what does netfs do anyway?
13:32  pd| militant: google suggests gnome-terminal is just super uncooperative =\
13:32  falconindy| hatten: mounts things like sshfs or nfs
13:33  amir_varasteh| timofonic: and ... what's the difrences ?
13:33  pd| lots of people report it always launching mozilla, despite their $BROWSER or gnome config etc
13:33  hatten| falconindy: so it can be removed if I don't use them?
13:33  falconindy| hatten: if you only have local block devices in fstab, you dont need it at all
13:33  amir_varasteh| between them ?
13:33  militant| pd: but i like it.  i like my tabs and i like my profile theme  :/
13:33  timofonic| amir_varasteh: Also the name is funny, it's the name of one of the ghosts in the Pacman game from the japanese videogame company Namco
13:33  MrElendig| militant: are you using gnome?
13:33  amir_varasteh| lol
13:33  MrElendig| militant: if so, system -> prefs -> prefered applications
13:33  timofonic| amir_varasteh: Less layers, faster, better, evolving
13:33  amir_varasteh| timofonic: and what's the difrences between them ?
13:33  MrElendig| militant: if not, have fun playing with gconf
13:34  amir_varasteh| great !!
13:34  hatten| falconindy: but the rest can be backgrounded? Including syslog-ng (the only one I'm unsure about as I don't know what it does)
13:34  amir_varasteh| tanQ !!
13:34  militant| MrElendig: nope, openbox
13:34  pd| militant: http://obvcode.blogspot.com/2008/06/arch-linux-changing-gnomes-default.html maybe ?
13:34  phrik| Title: Obvious Code: Arch Linux: Changing Gnome's default browser (at obvcode.blogspot.com)
13:34  pd| i've not used gnome before tho, i should shush
13:34  militant| pd: cool thx taking a look
13:34  MrElendig| militant: why gnome-terminal then? it's horrible :p
13:34  timofonic| amir_varasteh: And... it has a nice logo in coloured ASCII art! ;)
13:34  falconindy| hatten: syslog-ng is your system logger... backgrounding is only relevant as to how the daemons start. not how they operate once they're running
13:35  d_garbage| amir_varasteh, do have a look at the aur helpers entry in the wiki, it will possibly make things clearer
13:35  hatten| falconindy: okay, got that. So by backgrounding syslog-ng I might miss out on some early logging?
13:35  militant| MrElendig: what else would you suggest, if i typically want 3-4 tabbed terminals and green-on-black and all
13:35  amir_varasteh| d_garbage: i will do :)
13:35  Shapeshifter| militant: urxvt(d)
13:35  MrElendig| militant: rxvt-unicode-256color
13:35  MrElendig| militant: tabs sucks btw, just use tmux
13:35  pd| rxvt-unicode-256color, urxvt -pe tabbed
13:35  MrElendig| :p
13:35  militant| hrrrm.  if this doesn't fix it then i shall check those.  i tend to stick with what i'm comfortable with
13:36  MrElendig| or a better wm :p
13:36  macrobat| militant: urxvt -pe tabbed  for tabs
13:36  falconindy| hatten: doubtful. especially if its first. there's a separate logger in early userspace -- minilogd. when minilogd is killed, it dumps its contents into dmesg.log
13:36  amir_varasteh| TanQ ALL :X
13:36  MrElendig| urxvt-tabbed
13:36  MrElendig| the perl tabs are ewwy
13:36  hatten| falconindy: okay, thanks for the info
13:36  MrElendig| imo anyway
13:36  macrobat| i like the perl tabs better than the tabbed window :)
13:36  pd| but really, just move your whole computing experience into emacs and never again worry about silly things like tabs
13:37  pd| (and instead worry about silly things like emacs being a mindfk)
13:37  pd| =)
13:37  militant| i like my keybindings, they suit my netbook and my typical use bigtime
13:40  militant| pd: yay your link solved the issue.  thanks tons
13:41         * hatten is in love with the /exec command, no need to change tty to check something
13:45  ars1| hi i have problem with X and KDE...everything seems ok with resolution but after logging when splash screen is proceeding it stuck...
13:45  ars1| what to do ?
13:46  Stargazers| Well. Has it worked before?
13:46  Stargazers| Or did you just installed it?
13:46  d_garbage| try to get hold of some relevant logs?
13:46  ars1| what logs ?
13:46  d_garbage| that would be the first part of the job :)
13:47  ars1| but where are they located ?
13:47  d_garbage| ~/.xsession-errors maybe?
13:47  Stargazers| d_garbage: X starts ok?
13:47  d_garbage| other logs in /var/log
13:47  Stargazers| d_garbage: So it might be not a X error?
13:47  d_garbage| no idea :)
13:48  d_garbage| kdm has a log, if you use that
13:48  Stargazers| ars1: Have you used KDE before that in that machine?
13:48  ars1| Stargazers: yes i used radeonhd
13:48  ars1| and now radeon
13:48  ars1| ati
13:48  ars1| restart brb
13:49  Stargazers| ars1: If yes, have you tried to rename your old .kde4 or what-so-ever it is in KDE where it stores settings?
13:49  d_garbage| yeah ~/.kde4
13:53  sachael| is there a way to force a program to appear on a specific display in a dual monitor setup?
13:53  demonicmaniac| sachael: wm/DE dependent
13:53  ars1| when im too long in KDM it falls into black screen
13:53  ars1| any ideas ?
13:53  FliPPeh_| Man, ZSH is smart
13:54  FliPPeh_| It even knows the packages installed on my system
13:54  Stargazers| ars1: DPMS?
13:54  ars1| DPMS ?
13:54  Stargazers| ars1: Or power management settings in general
13:54  ars1| whats that
13:54  Stargazers| Display Power Manager System or something like that.
13:54  ars1| what with it ?
13:55  Stargazers| Well, if Xorg starts it -> black screen.
13:55  Stargazers| Until jo move mouse/press keyboard.
13:55  ars1| yes
13:55  ars1| so what to do ?
13:56  Stargazers| Well, xset can be used to set DPMS settings.
13:56  ars1| i never used it
13:56  ars1| i dont know what to do :X
13:56  Stargazers| Used what? xset?
13:56  ars1| y
13:57  demonicmaniac| !give ars1 beginner
13:57  demonicmaniac| hm what was it called again
13:57  Stargazers| Well, google "DPMS xset" and the first link.
13:57  demonicmaniac| !give ars1 guide
13:57  phrik| ars1: http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners_Guide
13:57  ars1| need to install links
13:57  Stargazers| www.shallowsky.com/linux/x-screen-blanking.html
13:58  Stargazers| ars1: Well not sure if that is the reason why you have a blank screen, but many times I have had problems with that DPMS stuff, though in other distro.
13:59  Stargazers| You can configure those settings in xorg configuration files too.
14:00  ars1| Stargazers: how to kill xorg ? if i killall -9 X it returns me to KDE and i see only mouse
14:00  demonicmaniac| not at all if you start kdm at boot
14:01  Stargazers| ars1: Do you use kdm or something?
14:01  ars1| aaa
14:01  Stargazers| ars1: Because I do not have any login manager, so I just quit openbox to get back to erminal.
14:01  ars1| i understand
14:01  ars1| ty
14:02  Stargazers| So try to stop that login manager as a root.
14:02  ars1| reboot brb
14:02  Stargazers| /etc/rc.d/kdm stop maybe?
14:02  Stargazers| Why?
14:02  Stargazers| Why you need to reboot?
14:02  Stargazers| Uhm.
14:03  q0_0p| anyone know how to logout of an X session
14:04  q0_0p| with out any sort of logout button
14:04  Stargazers| q0_0p: Well logout to what?
14:04  demonicmaniac| depends whether you logged into a session using a display manager
14:04  Stargazers| q0_0p: Kill your window manager?
14:04  tzervo| q0_0p: which window manager?
14:04  demonicmaniac| otherwise as Stargazers said kill your wm
14:05  q0_0p| at the moment i have tint2 with compiz
14:05         -!- gnuvince_ is now known as gnuvince
14:05  demonicmaniac| SIGQUIT compiz
14:05  Stargazers| Surely remember that killing is bad bad thing to do, just make peace and love, not war and kill }o/
14:05  q0_0p| i can just go to one of my tty* console and control+C it
14:06  Stargazers| Ctrl + c it? Well if you have started it there then why not.
14:06  demonicmaniac| kill -3 `pidof compiz`
14:07  demonicmaniac| would work from inside X in a term
14:07  Stargazers| killall compiz
14:08  soreau| q0_0p: What I do is put the following in bashrc, which will kill X and bring you to a tty
14:08  soreau| setxkbmap -option terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp
14:08  q0_0p| ah
14:08  q0_0p| soreau: thx
14:08  soreau| np
14:09  q0_0p| soreau: why was it disabled?
14:09  Stargazers| Because of Xorg.
14:09  demonicmaniac| could just disable DontZap in xorg.conf
14:09  Stargazers| They have changed it :(
14:09  Stargazers| Surely dunno why.
14:09  soreau| dontzap option is not enough for a standalone X session afaik
14:10  Stargazers| soreau: Isn't it, why not?
14:10  demonicmaniac| soreau: indeed it isn't
14:10  soreau| you would have to ask the X devs
14:10  demonicmaniac| that is really annoying
14:11  Stargazers| He left us.
14:11  Stargazers| :o
14:15  linfan| moi :)
14:15  Stargazers| Moi vain. In english and so.
14:16  linfan| I need help with making a daemon in /etc/rc.d - anybody volunteering ;)
14:16  Stargazers| !ask
14:16  phrik| Don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone is here, or if anyone is alive, or if anyone uses something. Just ask!
14:16  linfan| good
14:16  Stargazers| So feel free to ask.
14:17  tzervo| guys I have this command ' echo `date +%k:%M\ %a,%Y/%m/%d;acpi`>$HOME/.dzenbar ' thrown to a pipe to use in dzen, how do I add a tab between acpi and date commands?
14:18  tzervo| tried ^V, didn't work
14:18  Stargazers|  tzervo Can you echo "\t"?
14:18  xenor| \t
14:18  linfan| i have installed the new gogoc ipv6 client from binaries and placed it in /usr/gogoc. In order to start it I need to go to /usr/gogoc/bin and type ./gogoc. How is that done? Or should I simply put it in /etc/rc.local?
14:18  Stargazers| I mean printf "\t"
14:18  Stargazers| Dunno sure if echo will use them
14:18  tzervo| hm,I tried without the quotes or printf,will do
14:18  markatto| echo has several options to deal with escaped characters
14:19  Stargazers| tzervo: Remember to use " not ' because that makes \t not work.
14:19  Stargazers| Eg. they are used as a part of string.
14:19  tzervo| Stargazers: well, printf didnt' work, I'll try all suggestions, thanks all of you
14:20  linfan| I made a daemon that looks like this, but it fails: #Start gogo Client\ echo -n 'Starting the gogo Client: '\ /usr/gogoc/bin -f /usr/gogoc/bin/gogoc.conf\  echo 'gogoc'
14:20  demonicmaniac| tzervo: try echo -e
14:20  Stargazers| linfan: linfan Well, in what part it is failing?
14:21  Stargazers| And why it is under /usr/gogoc, err
14:21  speps| hi guys, can makepkg build with some parameter just a package in a multipackage PKGBUILD?I mean ex. a PKGBUILD that builds package A B C and i wanna just build B. Dunno if i'm clear. Thanks
14:22  demonicmaniac| o.O
14:22  Stargazers| If you are not clear, then you might use shower.
14:22  MrElendig| speps: doesn't really make sense
14:22  Stargazers| Sorry .__.
14:22  linfan| Stargazers: /etc/rc.d/gogocd start\ Starting the gogo Client: /etc/rc.d/gogocd: line 3: /usr/gogoc/bin: is a directory\ gogoc
14:22  demonicmaniac| i have not ever come across a multi package pkgbuild
14:22  MrElendig| speps: that won't reduce the ammount of compiling needed
14:22  Stargazers| linfan: Well, you are trying to start directory?
14:22  MrElendig| usually anyway
14:22  thewizord| so since my last install, I am noticing my laptops fan is spinning a lot slower and thus not cooling quickly (but will on other distributions/OS's). acpi-asus is loaded but there is no fan control listed in /proc/acpi?? any ideas on how to modify the speed?
14:23  MrElendig| linfan: /usr/share/pacman/rc-script.proto
14:23  Stargazers| linfan: Eg. /usr/gogoc/bin is a directory, isnt it?
14:23  MrElendig| linfan: start with reading that
14:23  ulughbegh| hi, is there any PKGBUILD creator available ?
14:23  linfan| yes
14:23  Stargazers| linfan: So why are you trying to start it..?
14:23  MrElendig| ulughbegh: yes, and it's called $EDITOR
14:23  ulughbegh| MrElendig, :D
14:23  tzervo| demonicmaniac: no, maybe I'm doing something wrong...could it be I am using zsh,not bash?
14:23  Stargazers| linfan: Start /usr/gogoc/bin/gogoc or what is the name of that executable.
14:23  linfan| can i put it like this: .//usr/gogoc/bin/gogoc
14:23  speps| MrElendig: have you ever seen mesa PKGBUILD? it compiles a lot of packages for example mesa ati-dri libgl. Now if i do makepkg i'll compile the whole thing, is there a parameter that can make me build just libgl for example? Again dunno if i'm clear
14:23  thewizord| MrElendig: help me out here brosive :P
14:24  tzervo| anyway,returning to man echo :)
14:24  demonicmaniac| tzervo: echo -e "\t b"
14:24  demonicmaniac| try it
14:24  Stargazers| linfan: Why .// in the beginnig?
14:24  tzervo| quotes are needed?
14:24  ulughbegh| MrElendig, just i will enter source url and it will generate PKGBUILD
14:24  tzervo| demonicmaniac: thx it worked
14:24  Stargazers| linfan: Just use /usr/gogoc/bin/gogoc -f /usr/bin/gogoc/gogoc.conf or where your conf was.
14:24  tzervo| missed the quotes
14:24  Stargazers| tzervo: Good that you made it work :)
14:24  linfan| Stargazers: manually it is to be started by going to cd /usr/gogoc/bin and then issue ./gogoc
14:25  Stargazers| linfan: So, you can just use /usr/gogoc/bin/gogoc from CLI, can't you?
14:25  ulughbegh| tzervo, pytyle was just what i want, thanks for tip
14:25  linfan| will see if it works
14:25  tzervo| ulughbegh: np
14:26  demonicmaniac| speps: no as it depends on each other
14:26  demonicmaniac| there are seperate packages for libgl ati-dri and mesa
14:26  demonicmaniac| but you need the whole package for compiling each time
14:26  linfan| Stargazers: /usr/gogoc/bin/gogoc  Failed to open specified file.  Last status context is: Configuration validation.  Finished.
14:27  Stargazers| linfan: Well did you gave -f and your config or what param you normally give to it?
14:27  Polizei| hal suckz..
14:28  Stargazers| Polizei: So does Jenna Jameson
14:28  Stargazers| .__.
14:28  Polizei| or it's dbus, i don't remember anymore..
14:28  Stargazers| Uhm sorry.
14:28  Polizei| Stargazers, Jenna Jameson sucks better :>
14:28  FliPPeh_| How'd I tell the sysinit scripts to automatically mount some of the entries in the fstab under MY uid?
14:28  linfan| ok, that words by adding the -f
14:28  Stargazers| Well, why it sucks anyway?
14:28  linfan| thanx
14:29  Stargazers| Polizei: :)
14:29  Polizei| because after every update it simply rewrites my stupid configs..
14:29  speps| demonicmaniac: let all the stuff compiled yet and i have to just recreate a package, a pkg.tar.xz . The thing i'm saying would be meanful since i do not want to recreate all packages. I'm asking about that, if there is no anything like that however could be implemented
14:29  Stargazers| linfan: Np. Did you get that work?
14:29  linfan| from commanline yes
14:29  Polizei| and i have no usb, i have no network manager, i have nothing working.. i'm thinking of chattr +i now :>
14:29  linfan| will reboot now and see if it works as daemon
14:29  Stargazers| linfan: So, then use that same command in your daemon part.
14:29  linfan| do I need to make it executable
14:30  Stargazers| linfan: Yeah if I remember right.
14:30  Stargazers| linfan: You do not need to restart.
14:30  Stargazers| linfan: Or reboot, I mean.
14:30  Beyecixramd| how do i configure the fstab to disable journaling in ext4?
14:30  Stargazers| linfan: You can test it first by running /etc/rc.d/yourdaemon
14:30  Beyecixramd| (if there's a way, otherwise, how to do it)
14:31  Stargazers| Beyecixramd: Maybe tune2fs?
14:31  Beyecixramd| so that's post installation, okay Stargazers, thanks
14:31  linfan| yeah it works - thanx
14:31  Stargazers| linfan: No problem.
14:31  Stargazers| Beyecixramd: Not sure if there is a param but many ext settings are managed with that if I am right.
14:32  tzervo| demonicmaniac: it works in the cli but not in my mkfifo file. I guess pipes ignore \something characters?
14:32  Stargazers| linfan: That way you used it, eg. "cd /usr/gogoc/bin" and then "./gogoc" is normally same to do /usr/gogoc/bin/gogoc or wathsoever.
14:33  Stargazers| linfan: That ./ means that "in the current folder, run app what comes after /"
14:33  Polizei| Beyecixramd, from ubuntuforums, mount option data=writeback  -- http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1109698.html
14:33  phrik| Title: No Journaling Ext4? [Archive] - Ubuntu Forums (at ubuntuforums.org)
14:33  Stargazers| In simplified.
14:33  linfan| ok
14:33  tzervo| this is why I did not need to get rid of newlines before?
14:33  toomanymirrors| For some reason www.archlinux.org is routing me to awg-baumann.de
14:34  gffa| toomanymirrors: Nice DNS Server you have there.
14:34  Stargazers| Spaces in filenames just sucks.
14:34  Beyecixramd| Polizei: where do i put data=writeback exactly in my device line?
14:35  Beyecixramd| Polizei: at the end?
14:35  MrElendig| ulughbegh: it is impossible to reliable auto-generate a PKGBUILD like that. Simply because there is no standardiced build system, and every app have it's own set of compile time --flags and so on
14:35  toomanymirrors| traceroute http://dpaste.com/185847/
14:35  p3nguin| sigh
14:35  phrik| Title: dpaste: #185847: stdin, by toomanymirrors (at dpaste.com)
14:35  linfan| i will just reboot to see if that is that
14:35  ulughbegh| MrElendig, i see
14:35  MrElendig| ulughbegh: it would be like trying to make one single jacket that would fit every person on the earth perfectly
14:35  ulughbegh| thx
14:36  Polizei| Beyecixramd, in the options field, the third right to left (last 2 are dump/pass), it should be `defaults' if you haven't touched your fstab
14:36  Beyecixramd| thanks, Polizei
14:36  MrElendig| tho that would actually be easier
14:36  ulughbegh| MrElendig, but that would be good , isnt it :D
14:36  demonicmaniac| straightjackets fit everyone
14:36  Polizei| Beyecixramd, if you have other options, separate them with commas (`,'), e.g.  data=writeback,something=nothing
14:36  Stargazers| No jackets at all! Freedom and nudity!
14:37         * VampirePenguin can leap a small straight jacket in a single bound
14:37  Beyecixramd| Polizei: can i delete "defaults" or should i put both? (defaults,data=writeback)
14:38  Polizei| Beyecixramd, you should replace the `defaults' with data=writeback, yes
14:38  Beyecixramd| okay, very useful info, Polizei thank you :)
14:38  Polizei| it's just a placeholder option
14:39  Stargazers| linfan: Sooo?
14:39  demonicmaniac| um
14:39  demonicmaniac| there is man mount
14:39  demonicmaniac| and then /ext4
14:39  demonicmaniac| >.>
14:39  linfan| works beautifully, would be nice though to get it less verbose - hehe
14:39  Beyecixramd| demonicmaniac: and there's an IRC channel, and an installation open, too :)
14:40  Stargazers| linfan: Nice to hear! Well, try to find params for less verbose OR just forward that output to /dev/null

14:41  demonicmaniac| !RTFM
14:41  phrik| Read the fine manual. (http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/rtfm.png)
14:41  Stargazers| linfan: Eg. /usr/gogoc/bin/gogoc and params > /dev/null
14:41  linfan| would that be to add like: /usr/gogoc/bin/gogoc -f /usr/gogoc/bin/gogoc.conf -y > /dev/null ?
14:41  Stargazers| Yeah.
14:41  demonicmaniac| ...would have been faster is all i'm saying
14:41  evanton| Stargazers: will check that, thanks
14:41  Stargazers| demonicmaniac: Exellnt :D
14:42  Stargazers| evanton: No problem, that is one possible reason if I remember right, at least I have some problems. In Beginneres Guide configuring X part there is more information about that

14:46  Stargazers| bbear: Not for you, sorry
14:47  twoface| Hi. I need to create some kind of searchable address book that I can share with my girlfriend (on Windows 7 / Ubuntu) - any recommendations?
14:47  Beyecixramd| Stargazers: nope, only 1024x768
14:47  Stargazers| Beyecixramd: For you, check if there is in /boot/grub/menu.lst and there if it is listed.
14:47  Stargazers| Oh, right.
14:47  Stargazers| twoface: Bash script with web interface <3
14:47  Beyecixramd| twoface: already asked in #Ubuntu?
14:48  twoface| Stargazers, i kinda like abook - but i hoped to avoid web interfaces :) i don't think i can, though
14:48  twoface| Beyecixramd, no - people in here tend to have better answers
14:48  Stargazers| twoface: Well if you need to share it window machine then it might be easiest way IMO.
14:49  Stargazers| twoface: Or just sync them in Google Calendar or something, dunno. I still think that much easier is justto make simple bash script
14:49  twoface| Stargazers, probably - i was hoping for vCard, but Windows Address Book doesn't understand several contacts in one file
14:49  linfan| Stargazers: this is how verbose it will be - lol: http://paste-it.net/public/w95ab2e/ - But I guess I can live with it
14:49  phrik| Title: gogoc - Paste-It.net (at paste-it.net)
14:50  Stargazers| twoface: So, just create Bash-script what will be run in server what is available everywhere you need it.
14:50  Stargazers| Eg. create .cgi
14:51  Stargazers| linfan: edid you tried that > /dev/null?
14:51  Stargazers| linfan: If you tried, then try to > /dev/null 2>&1

15:12  markatto| hatten: one sec i have to get out my logs
15:12  markatto| what was the timestamp on that?
15:13  hatten| about the same
15:13  hatten| I think earlier
15:13  hatten| but within 30 min
15:13  LugarSivi| umm whats the difference between pacman -S and pacman -Sy ?
15:13  LugarSivi| :D
15:13  hatten| grep'ing for udev would turn it up I think
15:13  d_garbage| LugarSivi,  see man pacman

15:14  LugarSivi| can't atm, im reading wiki
15:14  LugarSivi| and there is noreferance of it :p
15:14  d_garbage| y updates the package db
15:14  LugarSivi| ok, ty
15:14  hatten| markatto: it was divided into several messages from him (cannot remember who helped me >_<)
15:14  velcroshooz| LugarSivi, just dont install with pacman -Sy packagename - thats the only rule. upgrade with Syu's, install with S
15:15  LugarSivi| alright people
15:15  hatten| LugarSivi: updating the db while installing can break stuff
15:15  LugarSivi| I'm now on the crossroad, I just finished installing base on one PC next to me
15:15  LugarSivi| except I didn't install grub
15:15  LugarSivi| because I need lilo
15:16  LugarSivi| So what do I do first?
15:16  LugarSivi| mount / and /boot?
15:16  d_garbage| well, check the beginner's guide always :)
15:16  hatten| read up on some guide on how to install lilo?
15:16  hatten| d_garbage: I don't think it covers LILO =p
15:16  LugarSivi| wiki is very sparce on lilo
15:16  hatten| check google then
15:16  d_garbage| ah
15:16  LugarSivi| im checking it
15:17  LugarSivi| just hoped if somone here has 1st hand experience.
15:17         * hatten doesn't really know very much, the only tips I have is to google stuff most of the time =p
15:17  LugarSivi| this is my post here: http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=95661 My solution, that I'm looking into now is installing lilo.
15:17  phrik| Title: Arch Linux Forums / First boot after installation is frozen at grub (at bbs.archlinux.org)
15:17  hatten| markatto: is it really that much to go through? Or did yo uget distracted?
15:18  markatto| hatten: it's taking me a bit
15:19  hatten| markatto: how come? Is it that hard to find?
15:19  markatto| well i'm not sure exactly what you're looking for
15:19  sledgehammer| LugarSivi, the wiki's lilo page links the tldp lilo howto - which is written by people with 1st hand experience
15:19  markatto| hatten: how about i'll just give the log for the channel to you to look through
15:19  markatto| i'll give you like 3 days
15:19  hatten| markatto: hah sure
15:19  hatten| =D
15:19  hatten| I only need yesterday though
15:20  LugarSivi| sledgehammer: yea, I'm going through that howto atm
15:22  hatten| markatto: or, what was yesterday evening for me (from 26h ago to 22h ago)
15:22  cleancode| What are the consenquences if I turn off my advanced power management? [laptop user] Can it hurt my harddisk?
15:22  markatto| hatten: i'll just give you it all
15:22  hatten| sure thing
15:22  markatto| you okay with a .xz?
15:22  markatto| it's friggin huge if i don't compress it
15:22  pppo| cleancode: uh?why?
15:22  demonicmaniac|  markatto every archer ought to have xz utils installed...
15:22  hatten| markatto: I guess I should be, I have never used one but I'll probably just need to search some on the wiki
15:22  pppo| cleancode: hdparm -B 128 is the best option to use in laptop hdd
15:22  markatto| it's just 'unxz'
15:22  cleancode|  pppo: Does anybody here understand laptop-mode? My advanced power   management is set to 254 and load_cycle_count is same for   more than an hour and if I set it to 253 than cycles are 90   per minute.
15:23  demonicmaniac| pppo: that depends on the specific manufacturer
15:23  velcroshooz| tar will handle xz fine as well
15:23  hatten| markatto: okay, go ahead and ompload it (or whatever you wanna do)
15:23  demonicmaniac| each vendor handles -B his own way
15:23  pppo| demonicmaniac: as far i know, thats for enabling power managment on hdd,,,so hdd will spin down when not in use
15:23  demonicmaniac| pppo: it ought to set a time
15:23         -!- Wintervenom[1] is now known as Wintervenom
15:24  demonicmaniac| but not all drives respect it
15:24  demonicmaniac| some will simply spin down right the second no io is there
15:24  demonicmaniac| and thats bad
15:24  demonicmaniac| constant spin down/ spin up
15:24  demonicmaniac| will kill your drive
15:24  pppo| demonicmaniac: yeah, thats true too.
15:25  pppo| demonicmaniac: how to check out wich drives supports powermanagment?
15:25  demonicmaniac| it's safer to set it to 254 and have laptop-mode handle the spin down after xxx minutes without io
15:25  markatto| hatten: yeah i'm doing that as apache is acting up
15:25  demonicmaniac| support it they do but handle the numeric value after -B they don't in a consisten way
15:25  hatten| markatto: sure thing, I'll download it now and fix it tomorrow

16:30  demonicmaniac| nah that just tells you whether power mgmt is on or off

17:15    demonicmaniac | unrar can't create archives

17:16          WebLOCH | demonicmaniac, i had guessed that

17:17           tzervo | tar was just fine so far for me
17:17          WebLOCH | tzervo, tar just creates a non-compressed archive on its own though right?
17:18           tzervo | WebLOCH: tar -xvzf compresses it with gzip
17:18            jpate | WebLOCH: with z it gzips the archive

17:35         *        Borgasm reconizes. ;p
17:35          n0tch2k | pielgrzym: looks like snap from the artwiz pack
17:35          n0tch2k | :P
17:35        pielgrzym | n0tch2k: thanks :) let me investigate ;)
17:35          n0tch2k | pielgrzym: no problem
17:44           tzervo | Stalafin: since the manpage says "The idea is that ssh-agent is started in the beginning of an X-session or a login session" shouldnt it be put in .bash_profile?
17:44         Stalafin | evaluating bash_profile from bashrc; what about the other way round?
17:45         Stalafin | tzervo: ah, yeah; thanks for the reply; i just figured that out, too; hence my question about bash_profile and bashrc
17:45           tzervo | Stalafin: :) bash_profle sources bashrc
17:46         Stalafin | tzervo: indeed, i see this; i was just wondering if this is good manner; i read somewhere that 'sourcing one from another' is bad
17:46         Stalafin | tzervo: anyyhow; i guess path stuff should go to bash_profile, too?
17:47             k0sh | jpate: umm.. could you tell how exactly that line should look like?
17:47         sirscott | Anyone know what the "C" and "!" overlays for the folder / file icons with the subclipse plugin mean?
17:47           tzervo | Stalafin: yes, bash_profile is sourced at login and bashrc in interactive shells or something like that. I'm using zsh now and I don't remember it for sure
17:48         jaroslav | if you want to have something done during X-session startup you should NOT put it in your .bashrc
17:48         jaroslav | but .xinitrc instead
17:48        KittyKatt | .xinitrc <3
17:48            jpate | k0sh: $live->{"ponies"}="niagh, niagh, thats the sond of da ponies";
17:48         sirscott | Doing a "synchronize with repository" shows no pending changes, so it's not clear to me what'sup
17:48             k0sh | jpate: ah... k, thx :D
17:48           tzervo | jaroslav: I assume that ssh-agent could also be used from tty's, so it is better in bas_profile
17:49             k0sh | perl is too strange for me, php is so much saner
17:49         jaroslav | tzervo: yeah... but what if somebody opens more than one terminal?
17:49         Stalafin | tzervo: could it hence be that there are errors even in the wiki? http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Core_Utilities says for less, that one should put eval $(dircolors -b) into .bashrc; but that doesn't make sense, does it?
17:50            phrik | Title: Core Utilities - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
17:50            jpate | k0sh: i like perl. it's nice and stays out of your way for simple things
17:50         Stalafin | jaroslav: xinitrc is for x, bash_profile when i log into my user in general, right?
17:50         Stalafin | tzervo: not for less, for ls; sry
17:51           tzervo | Stalafin: eval $(dircolors -b) is for seeing colors eg. in ls, so it is used by interactive shells, so it should be in bashrc
17:51         jaroslav | Stalafin: more or less
17:51             Rasi | pielgrzym: terminus
17:51             Rasi | and snap is also used
17:51             Rasi | bl1nk | pacman -S ttf-terminus artwiz-fonts
17:51             k0sh | jpate: i like php even for simple scripts, tho i gotta use perl for its greater availablility for cli stuff
17:51            bl1nk | it's not terminus :x
17:51            bl1nk | sorrsy
17:51         Stalafin | tzervo: but than that variable is being exported every time, all over again
17:52            bl1nk | has anybody found a nice solution for chromiums proxy settings? (without using a DE)
17:53            bl1nk | without the need to restart chromium :p
17:53         jaroslav | Stalafin: .bash_profile is being read when you login, .bashrc each time you open a shell (eg. when you open xterm or when you're in zsh shell and you type 'bash')
17:53           tzervo | Stalafin: yup, don't know, I haven't researched on this for a long time, I could be wrong
17:53         Stalafin | jaroslav: indeed, that is what i understood
17:54         jaroslav | Stalafin: so settings like 'colorful less output' should be in .bashrc imho
17:54           tzervo | jaroslav: so if I put ssh-agent in bash_profile, it sets the variables once and they are "exported" for more than one terminals, right?
17:55         jaroslav | what do you mean by 'ssh-agent'?
17:55         Stalafin | jaroslav: but that should be the same thing for dircolors -b, should it not? the exported var is the same all the time
17:55         jaroslav | you're going to define a environmental variable or start a command?
17:56         Stalafin | jaroslav: yes, that's what he means: ssh-agent -s sets environmental vars, which are accessed by ssh-add
17:57         jaroslav | so .bashrc should be OK
17:57         jaroslav | tzervo: settings that are placed in .bash_profile are not 'exported' anywhere
17:58         jaroslav | it's .bash_profile that normally sources .bashrc, not vice versa
17:58         Stalafin | ssh-agent -s also demonizes it.......
17:58         jaroslav | Stalafin: so if ssh-agent -s is a command that starts a daemon (which should be running only once) .bashrc is not a good place for it

13:00          daevski | rooob, if you check the man page, I'm pretty sure it's -a in rsync also

13:01      velcroshooz | rooob, chrome has alot of the tracking stuff enabled by default .. and if you had a choice in running a closed or open source version of an app, why not use the open source?
13:01            rooob | daevski, -avz looks good for me.. for regular / and /home backups
13:01            rooob | should be fine, right?

13:07       krankkatze | hi
13:07       krankkatze | I'm having troubles with Xorg
13:07       krankkatze | it sometimes restart by itself
13:08       krankkatze | I have no idea what logfiles I should give you
13:08           wonder | maybe is crashing?
13:08           wonder |  /var/log/Xorg.0.log
13:08       krankkatze | Xorg.0.log.old ?
13:08           wonder | velcroshooz, why are you talking about chrome?
13:09           wonder | velcroshooz, chromium doesn't have any tracking stuff. it has the same thing as firefox
13:09       krankkatze | because X just restarted, so I guess the Xorg.0.log is the one for the new session
13:09           wonder | krankkatze, then both
13:09       krankkatze | ok
13:09      velcroshooz | wonder, rooob asked about it - my suggestion was chromium over chrome
13:09            rooob | ye
13:10           wonder | i always suggest chromium over chrome mostly because is in our repos vs a blob from google :D
13:10        LugarSivi | Can someone tell to this arch newbie can I just c/p this: http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HAL#Removing_USB_flash_causes_improper_unmount script and use it for myself or do I need to change some parameters? DEVNAME?
13:10            phrik | Title: HAL - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
13:10      velcroshooz | well and its open source, for me, that means ill always support it more, especially because its not lacking in features vs the blob
13:10       falconindy | chromium's backporting really stupid features from chrome =(
13:11           wonder | falconindy, for your information chrome is chromium+google logo+some tracking
13:11       krankkatze | wonder: http://pastebin.com/GPX70DsS -> Xorg.0.log
13:11       falconindy | i noticed in recent builds, the http:// prefix on URLs is masked unless its secure
13:11            phrik | Title: X.Org X Server 1.7.6 Releas - Anonymous - GPX70DsS - Pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
13:11           wonder | falconindy, so is the other way around :D
13:12       falconindy | err, no? this is a feature that has existed in chrome for some time now, and only recently has appeared in chromium
13:12       falconindy | i understand the flow of chromium->chrome
13:12       krankkatze | and the "old" one http://pastebin.com/eBHikqcs
13:12            phrik | Title: X.Org X Server 1.7.6 Releas - Anonymous - eBHikqcs - Pastebin.com (at pastebin.com)
13:12       falconindy | the term 'backport' isn't really accurate, but it describes what's happening
13:12      velcroshooz | one thing i love about chromium is its lack of being gtk compliant heh ;) every other webkit browser i try since im using a dark gtk theme i get dark input boxes, i hate that. chromium doesnt follow the rule.
13:13           wonder | velcroshooz, +1
13:13           wonder | krankkatze, my guess was correct
13:13       falconindy | velcroshooz: that'll no doubt change. in the past month or so, they've added "proper" font support
13:13           wonder | krankkatze, wanna use xorg 1.8?
13:13            rooob | sudo mount -o noatime,data=writeback,barrier=0,nobh,commit=60,noauto_da_alloc /dev/sdb1 /mnt/eacs/
13:13            rooob | is that the fastest I can make ext4
13:14       krankkatze | I've heard about it wonder
13:14            rooob | without getting rid of the benefits (non power kill benefits)
13:14       krankkatze | but it's not in the repositories now, right?
13:14       krankkatze | is there any doc about installing it?
13:14           wonder | !xorg18
13:14            phrik | http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2010-April/016387.html
13:14       krankkatze | thanks :]
13:14       falconindy | rooob: dont disable write barriers unless you have a good reason for it
13:14           wonder | krankkatze, it is and it has a newer intel version
13:14            rooob | falconindy, I'm making a redundant backiup
13:15            rooob | I have no powerout fear
13:15       krankkatze | hmmmm
13:15       krankkatze | wonder: I'm using a 2.6.32 kernel
13:15            rooob | falconindy, isn't there a speed benefit?
13:15       krankkatze | "Kernel 2.6.33 from testing is recommended due to DRI improvements in
13:15       krankkatze | that version."
13:15      Beyecixramd | people, i'm disappointed about Moblin, also tried Arch with E17, and i don't like any of these, can anyone helping me picking a cool distro for my netbook? (i mean, with a customized shell, not like GNOME, or KDE, or nothing like that)
13:15           wonder | krankkatze, update
13:15            rooob | Will the filesystem frag more if it's disabled?
13:15           wonder | :D
13:15       falconindy | rooob: if you're making a redundant backup, why is speed an issue?
13:15            rooob | falconindy, laptop backup
13:16           wonder | LugarSivi, what are you using? xfce/gnome/kde?
13:16       krankkatze | wonder: I can't
13:16       krankkatze | my wifi isn't detected by the 2.6.33
13:16        LugarSivi | wonder: will install xfce
13:16       falconindy | rooob: right, but write barriers have to do with data integrity. wouldn't you want to make sure that the backup was successful rather than finishing a few seconds earlier?
13:16            rooob | oh, sure I guess
13:17           wonder | krankkatze, what wifi?
13:17           wonder | ralink?
13:17       krankkatze | I think so, let me check
13:17        LugarSivi | wonder: why does it matter?
13:17       krankkatze | no, Atheros
13:17           wonder | LugarSivi, it matters mostly because gnome doesn't use hal so the workaround is useless
13:18        LugarSivi | I see, thanks for info.
13:18           wonder | krankkatze, check forum. i think you have to blacklist some modules
13:18        LugarSivi | so i can just copy paste script
13:19           heftig | wonder: gnome-vfs still depends on hal
13:19           wonder | i know
13:20           wonder | Jan made a comment about it today
13:20           heftig | where?
13:20           wonder | ml
13:20           heftig | general?
13:20           wonder | yes
13:20           wonder | hal dependencies thread
13:20      velcroshooz | short of it is gnome-vfs is being phased out, so cutting hal out of it first prolly wont happen right?
13:20       krankkatze | wonder: can't find anything
13:21           wonder | velcroshooz, correct
13:21           wonder | brb
13:23            yitz_ | I just got political... Never did that before
13:29           wonder | back
13:29           wonder | krankkatze, update to 2.6.33 and start debugging. dmesg logs
13:30           wonder | use ethernet until you figure out why the hell is not working :D
13:30           schmrz | Hello Everyone. After the last update my video drivers (xf86-video-ati) are not working correctly. After a while, after logging in (sometimes it freezes when GDM start), it generates blank screen with random lines. This also happens if I run a game (Tremulous for example).
13:30           schmrz | Disabling KMS stoped the freezing part. But I still get a lot of glitches.
13:30           schmrz | For example, when using gedit and editing some text, the text disappears and random lines are drawn on the gedit text area.
13:31           schmrz | Is there a way to downgrade my drivers ?
13:32        d_garbage | !downgrade
13:32            phrik | http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Downgrade_packages - This is how you do that.
13:32           wonder | schmrz, i've heard that updating to xorg18 made ati drivers work beautifully
13:32           schmrz | d_garbage: Reading it, thx.

13:33           wonder | yes, open that link
13:33        d_garbage | yes, that was it
13:33           schmrz | Thanks, I will try that first.

13:45             Mion | and if so, with what drivers?
13:45        aparaatti | Mion: it works on ubuntu out of the box
13:45             Mion | and have you loaded those drivers?
13:45             Mion | find out what driver you need and install/load it
13:45        aparaatti | Mion: I have loaded several modules, but I think the problem is related to lsusb not showing anything
13:46             Mion | since it works on ubuntu, plug it in there and see what it uses

13:46             Mion | cards
13:46             Mion | the 2 later that is

13:53             Mion | devicekit on its own is not a replacement for hal
13:53      Beyecixramd | Mion: it's in the Arch wiki, right? (the installing instructions, etc)
13:53             Mion | because hal does a lot more
13:53           schmrz | wonder: Hey, updating to xorg18 didn't help :\
13:53             Mion | Beyecixramd: are you running a de?
13:53            Janno | wrong command :X
13:53        d_garbage | there's something called  udisks as well
13:54      Beyecixramd | Mion: E17, but actually... i'm going to install now (i had E17 some time ago) but i might give Gnome-Shell a try
13:54             Mion | just use thunar of pcmanfm or whatever then
13:54           soreau | How can I figure out what the torcs package installed where?
13:54             Mion | both of them does automounting
13:54      Beyecixramd | Mion: Nautilus or the integrated E17 file browser will work?
13:55        d_garbage | soreau, pacman -Ql <package>
13:55      Beyecixramd | and also, what about X freezing without HAL?
13:55             Mion | if you are not using gdm/kdm then you have to explicitly start a consolekit session for it to work
13:55             Mion | Beyecixramd: X isn't freezing
13:55           wonder | Beyecixramd, udisk+upower+media-player-info+pm-quirks+x = hal
13:55           wonder | don't forget about udev
13:55           soreau | d_garbage: thanks!
13:56           wonder | schmrz, too bad. don't downgrade and use it
13:56      Beyecixramd | Mion: how do i start a consolekit session within SLiM?
13:56             Mion | Beyecixramd: it's just you that havn't installed and/or told xorg to use xf86-input-mouse/keyboard
13:56             Mion | Beyecixramd: edit xinitrc
13:56           wonder | schmrz, maybe use ati straight from git will help?
13:56        d_garbage | soreau, man pacman of course for more goodies :)
13:56      Beyecixramd | Mion: what to add in xinitrc?
13:56           wonder | schmrz, or maybe tweeking xorg.conf?
13:56   VampirePenguin | as dumb as it sounds ive been having problems with my trash can not wanting to empty in gnome 2.3
13:56             Mion | Beyecixramd: btw, hal is not the horrible bloated monster that you think it is
13:56           schmrz | wonder: I don't have an xorg.conf :\
13:56        d_garbage | VampirePenguin, somehow got a root perm file in there?
13:57           schmrz | wonder: You mean compiling the latest version myself ? Link to repo ?
13:57      Beyecixramd | Mion: is not that, i had problems on my main rig, and seems not to work on my netbook too
13:57           wonder | schmrz, is in aur
13:57   VampirePenguin | dont think so

14:04      Beyecixramd | Mion: all devices should be compatible with Mass Storage... or at least have a mode switcher for it... oh wait, DRMs won't work there :P
14:04   VampirePenguin | my mp3 player was mtp when i bought it but i jsut had to change the variable in one line of text config files and now its ums

14:05   VampirePenguin | samsung does a good job
14:06   VampirePenguin | cowon and iriver do too
14:06             Mion | Beyecixramd: anyway, a typical problem is problems with having both uhci and ehci loaded at once
14:06         scales11 | Thanks guys I keep coming back to arch and I hate setting it all up.
14:06   VampirePenguin | Edward226, i never fill in a hostname value
14:06          kelnoky | best pure mp3 player is a sansa clip+ atm
14:06             Mion | in some cases it causes problems
14:06      Beyecixramd | Mion: i saw ehci and uhci as error messages sometimes...
14:06        Edward226 | VampirePenguin niether do I so it must be picking it up from a system value.
14:06         scales11 | +1 for the sands clip it is great
14:07   VampirePenguin | Edward226, it is
14:07      Beyecixramd | VampirePenguin: Cowon doesn't do a good job... COWON FUCKING ROCKS
14:07   VampirePenguin | freenode and oftc take a while somtimes for me bc of interne t traffic

14:07   VampirePenguin | /etc/rc.conf
14:07      Beyecixramd | aargh i can't decide for a netbook interfacee....
14:07         scales11 | How often do you run pacman -Syu?
14:07      Beyecixramd | can the UNR destkop be installed in Arch?
14:08             Mion | if it works on linux, yes
14:08             Mion | and it's license allows it
14:08             Mion | those are the only 2 things that can stop you
14:08      Beyecixramd | Mion: hmmm any recommendations? otherwise, ill go for UNR on Arch
14:08             Mion | a tiler
14:09         * VampirePenguin pets his gnome 2.30
14:09      Beyecixramd | Mion: a 10 inch screen + a 1024x600 res = tiling fail
14:09   VampirePenguin | with guake
14:09             Mion | Beyecixramd: wrong
14:09             Mion | Beyecixramd: it's much better than floating on small screens
14:10      Beyecixramd | why, Mion? with 24 windows open, the space for each of them would be very very small
14:10             Mion | more efficient, and it's easier to use without a mouse, which is a good thing, since the touchpads on most netbooks are horrible
14:10             Mion | and none of them have a clit
14:10      Beyecixramd | the touchpad on my dell mini 10v is pretty comfortable
14:10             Mion | Beyecixramd: why would you have 24 windows displayed at once?
14:10      watsonalgas | what's a clit?
14:11         scales11 |  Bahamas
14:11        d_garbage | an ebook conversion app?
14:11             Mion | Beyecixramd: you don't have to have every windows visible at once just because you are using a tiler
14:11      Beyecixramd | Mion: i normally have: 2 terminals, a web browser (maybe 2 windows and lots of tabs in each) the contact list + conversations, audio player, and a download manager
14:11         scales11 | Haha
14:11   VampirePenguin | i have arch current no my eee 900 and its more than sufficient with gnome 2.28
14:11        Edward226 | I definately like bitchx the best for irc
14:11 digitteknohippie |  watsonalgas, lmao
14:11             Mion | watsonalgas: http://xkcd.com/243/

14:11      Beyecixramd | i know Mion, but having more windows open in a floating WM would allow you to put one over another
14:12         scales11 | Which Tiler would you recommend for newbs
14:12   VampirePenguin | scrotwm
14:12             Mion | Beyecixramd: you can do that in a tiler too

14:37              nn_ | only problem is sound is coming out over 3.5mm not hdmi

15:11      velcroshooz | oxez: run an Syu? alsa-lib is 1.0.22 here
15:11            td123 | Janno: except gmail :P
15:11             oxez | velcroshooz: Not the library, the driver itself
15:11      velcroshooz | heh
15:11      velcroshooz | how does it run a newer lib than its own version?
15:11             oxez | Mion: I have the latest one, 2.6.33.2-1
15:12             Mion | oxez: write yourself a PKGBUILD to build the latest alsa kernel module then
15:12             Mion | I asume that you have actually booted the .33 kernel
15:12            Janno | td123: theres a fix for that in Gmail Labs :)
15:13           wonder | velcroshooz, what i don't like is that check explicity for chromiu/chrome rather for webkit
15:13             oxez | Mion: lol yea :p Apparently 2.6.33 includes ALSA-1.0.21, so I'll have to do it another way
15:13           wonder | epiphany can handle very well html5 with h264(i think)

15:14           wonder | :D
15:14             oxez | Mion: Building alsa myself would work right? I'd just have to re-do it everything I let pacman upgrade the kernel
15:14             Mion | I hate that chromium doens't support OSS when using html5
15:14             oxez | s/everything/everytime

15:18             Mion | nawi: check what it actually picked

15:18            Janno | gnome devs have been busy O_o
15:18             nawi | Mion, it picks 'h264_vdpau' but then doesn't work with that
15:18             nawi | video plays fine without vdpau
15:19             nawi | what was the command to install older mplayer version again?
15:19             Mion | unless it was renamed, it should have picked ffh264vdpau

15:19             Mion | jnd: mplayer/vlc
15:19             Mion | jnd: specially if you can use vdpau or vaapi
15:20             Mion | jnd: there is scritps to auto-launch them or embed them in your browser

15:25             Mion | downgrading doesn't really work on arch, as you just experienced
15:26            anrxc | you need to upgrade to match latest x264, your mirror is out of sync
15:26             Mion | anrxc: no, he downgraded mplayer

15:27          Blaargh | what were you trying to play nawi?
15:27          Blaargh | i.e. codec etc.
15:27           wonder | nawi, if you don't have vdpau capable driver mplayer will skip it
15:27          Blaargh | vdpau still works. great.

15:40            anrxc | nawi: let's say it's mplayer, you can then build the old mplayer against the new x264 and ffmpeg

15:56      velcroshooz | Beyecixramd, because once you install make, you'll need other packages from that group anyway, (fakeroot, etc)

16:01           twoobs | unetbootin 4.33
16:01      Beyecixramd | LugarSivi: your screen should go at the max refresh rate supported if you have KMS (Intel, nouveau, and don't know about other drivers)

16:03        LugarSivi | he automatically set resolution to a way higher then my monitor can support (at least he says he did). But he didn't. So I wonder is there some other too.

16:04         cupantae | Grim147 the second digit should be a 7
16:04      velcroshooz | LugarSivi, man xrandr. instead of trying to make it work automatically for you, try setting the values yourself
16:04      thinkpadx61 | wonder: it worked before ... ?
16:04         cupantae | oh sorry and the first!

16:05          Grim147 | cupantae, yea i did chown 777 no luck
16:05      velcroshooz | LugarSivi, ah okay, well i cant think of another one off the top of my head ;)
16:05         cupantae | twoobs: ok, it's probably the image itself, so. are you dl'ing the usb image as someone else said?
16:05         cupantae | Grim147: chmod 77x :-)
16:05        LugarSivi | alright, np
16:06         cupantae | Grim147: chown is for changing the owner. chmod for the permissions
16:06      velcroshooz | thinkpadx61, make sure you havent hit the hardware button for wifi if your convinced it was working fine before
16:06          Grim147 | cupantae, lol wtf am i doing , sorry dude
16:06          Grim147 | cupantae, sleep guy , thanks :P
16:06        LugarSivi | oh I got my solution
16:06          Grim147 | sleepy*
16:06        LugarSivi | OSD on monitor LOL
16:06         sputnick | Mion, that works ;)
16:06      velcroshooz | thinkpadx61, google says thats the #1 reason for the error
16:07      thinkpadx61 | velcroshooz: omg, i feel incredibly stupid
16:07      velcroshooz | heehee ;)
16:07         cupantae | Grim147: me too. have any of you heard of kratom, though? it's a herbal drug (legal!) that's a bit like what people who love coffee claim coffee does
16:08         cupantae | best thing ever
16:08           twoobs | cupantae: yep just grabbing the torrent now - cheers!
16:10   oldmerovingian | There is no better feeling than finally finding out what was causing my kernel panics!  WOOOOOO!
16:10      velcroshooz | i can haz answers wif googles
16:10          Grim147 | cupantae, ill look into it :P

16:17          doc_who | hello
16:21           peturi | Hi, im about to download and install archlinux, planig to use it as a desktop... Is using x64 more problematic? (firefox, flash etc.) ???
16:22         cupantae | peturi: no. go for it
16:22            taree | nope
16:22      velcroshooz | peturi, you'd need 32 bit libs or a 32 bit chroot for wine or for binary linux based 32 bit games. thats about the only difference.
16:23         cupantae | i'm not sure if there's much of an advantage, but the only thing you could consider "problematic" is that you'd have some libraries in 32bit and 64bit on your system
16:23         cupantae | but it's not problematic
16:23           peturi | okay thanks
16:23           peturi | not much of an advantace... ? won't my system be faster with x64?
16:23         cupantae | you just use yaourt -S bin32-THING and hardly notice
16:23         cupantae | peturi: you can look up performance tests, but i really don't know
16:23           peturi | ok
16:23           peturi | ay
16:24         cupantae | the idea is that the cpu has more "room", e.g. for floating point numbers
16:24         cupantae | like more precision
16:24      velcroshooz | peturi, depends on what your doing. the internet wont go faster, your typing wont increase. graphics/video editing, encoding, compiling can see advantages from 64, amongst other things.
16:24         cupantae | and apparently that can be good for things like multimedia
16:24           peturi | okay thanks
16:24         cupantae | compiling can also be slower, though
16:24          shields | 64 bit Flash is buggy
16:25         cupantae | people who know what they're talking about disagree about it, is my impression
16:25         cupantae | shields: flash is buggy!
16:25      velcroshooz | flash is buggy period, but good point. hulu wont work in 64 bit.
16:25         cupantae | on any platform
16:25            taree | html5 > flash anyways
16:25           peturi | hulu ?
16:26         cupantae | peturi: the bottom line is, anything you can do on 32bit, you can do on 64bit with some duplication of libraries
16:26            ezech | watching pacman at work gives me strange but pleasant feeling
16:26      velcroshooz | online tv shows .. people complain about it, so i thought id mention it
16:26           peturi | cupantae: ok thanks
16:26      velcroshooz | ezech, even better with ILoveCandy easter egg ;)
16:26            intgr | peturi: In practice there's little difference between 32-bit and 64-bit. Except that some things (like Wine) aren't ported to 64-bit yet.
16:26            taree | i think it is strange how a crappy proprietary piece of code (flash) is the ad hoc benchmark for how good an OS is..
16:26           wonder | shields, flash 64 is not more buggy than 32 bit
16:27           wonder | shields, in general flash is buggy
16:27            intgr | And Firefox in particular seems to consume much more memory on 64-bit.
16:27         cupantae | as far as i know, flash is only available in 64 on linux, although that might not be true anymore...
16:28          Blaargh | wtf?
16:28      velcroshooz | it has 32 and 64 ;)
16:28         cupantae | sorry
16:28         -!- Sorcier_FXK is now known as KeyboardFury
16:28      velcroshooz | 64 wasnt available for quite awhile
16:28         cupantae | i mean 64bit flash is only available on linux, i.e. not other platforms
16:28           wonder | flashplugin x86_64 is available for more than 1 year
16:28            intgr | peturi: But using a 32-bit OS will destroy your geek cred if you care about that sort of thing. ;)
16:29         cupantae | intgr: this is the most important factor

16:52             pppo | cupantae: yeah, im ther
16:53         cupantae | just put "vga=xxx" (without quotes)
16:53      velcroshooz | thats not gonna work if he has a vid card with kms enabled by default ..
16:53         cupantae | where xxx is a 3-digit number
16:53            td123 | NewWorld: what cupantae said

16:56    BeholdMyGlory | Hi. I'm having some trouble with PowerDevil (KDE power manager) and cpufreq-utils. It seems that no matter what I do cpufreq-utils/PowerDevil won't set the frequency of my processor to what I want. An example: http://pastebin.com/y2tf6X8k note that even though 2GHz is an available frequency step, and ever though I've set it to "performance", it still sets the frequency to 800MHz.
16:56      velcroshooz | so he is running kms

16:56           mewshi | in rc.conf, is ! for blacklisting modules?  I'm looking at the wireless setup page (it's been WAY too long since I got this dirty with linux)
16:56         cupantae | oh, i'm old fashioned. i like to know what it's doing so i still have a full xorg.conf
16:56      velcroshooz | mewshi, yes, and rc.conf explains what ! and @ are for in the comments
16:56            Janno | BeholdMyGlory: try 2 GHz not 2GHz
16:56         cupantae | also, i have a crt set at more than its native res

16:58             pppo | ok, thanks cupantae ...
16:58    BeholdMyGlory | Janno: Where, exactly? I've not set it anywhere (note that I'm not using the cpufredq daemon, I'm only using PowerDevil with cpufreq-utils). And cpufreq-utils does recognize 2GHz as a valid frequency step.

16:58   DefunctProcess | whats that irc command to check ur messages?

17:02  OpenBluntSurgry | any ideas on this?
17:02  OpenBluntSurgry | ifconfig -a shows wlan0
17:02  OpenBluntSurgry | the device is on
17:02      velcroshooz | BeholdMyGlory, my bios has the ability to do the same thing cpufreq does, and in fact when its enabled keeps me from changing setting within linux .. i also run powernow-k8 as well. might be something to look into .. amd's 'cool and quiet' stuff can run into problems with cpufreq.
17:03      velcroshooz | OpenBluntSurgry, installed firmware?
17:03             tlvb | OpenBluntSurgry: I get that sometimes. So far the only thing that helps is turning of the laptop, popping it open poking the wnic with my thumb reassembling everything and boot it
17:03    BeholdMyGlory | velcroshooz: Okay, I'll try messing around with the BIOS settings and see if I can find anything, thanks.
17:04  OpenBluntSurgry | velcroshooz can you link me to this>
17:04      velcroshooz | OpenBluntSurgry, id need to know your card model first

17:10      velcroshooz | Kovensky,  http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Clients - would you rather believe someone's opinion or just try some for yourself? ;) i use sonata, there is my two cents.

17:10        rabbitear | !grab velcroshooz
17:10            phrik | rabbitear: Tada!
17:10      velcroshooz | !nograb
17:10            phrik | ha ha bitch, can't grab velcroshooz
17:10              scj | is quod libet a mpd frontend?
17:10        rabbitear | lol
17:10         JavaAtom | I hate to ask, but is there a howto for setting up pms properly?
17:10         cupantae | i really like ncmpcpp
17:10         JavaAtom | ps3 media server, that is.
17:11        rabbitear | JavaAtom: interesting
17:11            yitz_ | !give JavaAtom wiki pms
17:11         Kovensky | I could hack global hotkeys myself with perl and xbindkeys I guess
17:11            phrik | JavaAtom: Music Player Daemon - ArchWiki: <http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Music_Player_Daemon>
17:11      velcroshooz | JavaAtom, im pretty ninja at it if you want some help - running it now
17:11         Kovensky | there should be a MPD.pm :>
17:11        rabbitear | ps3 is half way media, but you mean over a network JavaAtom ?
17:11         Kovensky | (if that's missing)
17:11         JavaAtom | velcroshooz: Well, I got ushare running and it worked fine,
17:11         Kovensky | but as for the others...
17:11         *       Kovensky checks those out
17:11          VCoolio | scj: right it's not, that's what you get when you try everything ;P
17:12         JavaAtom | velcroshooz: But I'm looking to get it to do the auto-reencoding thing as well.
17:12        MrElendig | bha, stupid router is stupid
17:12        rabbitear | JavaAtom: in fact, with a ps3 you do alot of converting file formats n'stuff, before its really usable..
17:12      velcroshooz | JavaAtom, 'transcoding' i believe is what your looking for
17:12        MrElendig | OpenBluntSurgry: in case you missed it, install the frimware, as the wiki says
17:12         -!- wentam|afk is now known as wentam
17:12         JavaAtom | velcroshooz: ah yeah. Transcoding. My vocabulary is crappy at the moment.
17:12             tlvb | why would one want a separate boot partition/fs?
17:12        rabbitear | JavaAtom: for the media off the ps3, look up npnp
17:12        MrElendig | OpenBluntSurgry: http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wireless_Setup#iwl3945.2C_iwl4965_and_iwl5000-series
17:12            phrik | Title: Wireless Setup - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
17:12      velcroshooz | JavaAtom, no worries, i use transcoding for my mkv's all the time. where are you stuck?
17:13        rabbitear | JavaAtom: there's lots, but I used mediatome, or something like that
17:13         JavaAtom | rabbitear: It runs xvid codecs just fine, but my goal is to stream to the PS3 via its media functions.
17:13         JavaAtom | velcroshooz: I just installed pms. That's where I am with it.
17:13        rabbitear | JavaAtom: stream the output of the ps3?
17:13         Kovensky | hmm, transcoding...
17:13        rabbitear | JavaAtom: you have to grab the signal via hardware then..
17:14           mewshi | Huh.  Ths might be bad.  It seems to be stuck at installing GRUB >.<
17:14         Kovensky | so hard to get it right ;X
17:14         JavaAtom | rabbitear: no, doing what mediatomb and ushare also claim to do: provide a UPnP capable stream to the PS3, sharing my library of video files such that the PS3 can read them.
17:14         cupantae | does anyone know a way to edit the tags of .m4a files on linux?
17:14         Kovensky | http://forums.animesuki.com/showthread.php?p=3015675#post3015675
17:14        rabbitear | JavaAtom: it works.....
17:14      velcroshooz | JavaAtom, i can screenshot my transcoding settings in pms if you want, but ive messed with very little out of the stock setup
17:14        MrElendig | !give cupantae google edit m4a tags linux
17:14        rabbitear | JavaAtom: sometimes, your router has a UPnP setting, that you have to do, but thats about it..

10:55          frankS2 | hm how can i get mumble for arch? Its not in arch by def
10:55          frankS2 | nor pacman reps
10:55     sledgehammer | frankS2, in the aur
10:55      velcroshooz | frankS2, its in aur
10:56          frankS2 | how do i add "aur"
10:56          frankS2 | whats the rep url
10:56     sledgehammer | !give frankS2 aur
10:56            phrik | frankS2: The Arch Linux User-Community Repository is a place to share user contributed PKGBUILDs. URL: http://aur.archlinux.org Wiki: http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR

10:56             ldvx | frankS2: you use yaourt/clyde or whatever
10:56         *   sledgehammer groans
10:57       vileperson | It's been months and I see nothing's changed. hehe
10:57       vileperson | I missed my arch-box so bad
10:59           tuntis | I've got a problem with windows only showing white when using Compiz with catalyst-test. A utility I downloaded called "compiz-check" says the following: "Error: No rendering method in use (AIGLX, Xgl or Nvidia)".
10:59           tuntis | What should I do?
11:00           soreau | tuntis: Your graphics drivers arent installed correctly
11:00           soreau | tuntis: white screen with compiz almost always indicates drivers using software rendering or otherwise not installed correctly
11:00           tuntis | Should I just try reinstalling the AUR package?
11:01           soreau | You need to correctly install your drivers, yes
11:01           soreau | Actually, what model card do you have tuntis ?
11:01            Shyde | also need to make sure xorg is actually using the drivers
11:01           tuntis | Radeon HD4890
11:02           tuntis | and the fglrx module is loaded and a 3D app that barely works with opensource drivers works perfectly, so I think the drivers are in use
11:02   oldmerovingian | tuntis: Have you disabled KMS?
11:02           tuntis | no
11:02           soreau | Then you could use catalyst drivers which may or may not have support for latest kernel and X, or use the open radeon driver which definitely supports latest kernel and X
11:02   oldmerovingian | tuntis: Add radeon.modeset=0 to the kernel line and try
11:03           tuntis | oldmerovingian: I'll try, thanks
11:03   oldmerovingian | tuntis: It worked for my stupid ati card
11:03         JavaAtom | velcroshooz: Hey...
11:03         JavaAtom | velcroshooz: pms works wonderfully
11:04           soreau | twss?
11:04         JavaAtom | velcroshooz: So thanks for the help.
11:04      velcroshooz | JavaAtom, good to hear, i agree. ive not found anything better and ive run them all.
11:05         JavaAtom | velcroshooz: Well, the funny part is that it'll run MKVs -sort of-... I'm going to have to offline-transcode the good stuff.
11:07      velcroshooz | JavaAtom, yeah, high def mkv can get out of sync pretty bad regardless of the settings. im hoping to switch to a pc on the tv pretty soon because the ps3 isnt quite cutting it for a media server.
11:10        MrElendig | velcroshooz: get a nvidia card and use vdpau
11:10        MrElendig | :p
11:11      velcroshooz | yeah thats the plan .. in the process of building my new main box, and the one im on now is getting htpc duty (its got nvidia already)
11:16         JavaAtom | velcroshooz: I tried running that with a dual-core. Didn't work so well at 1080, so I switched to letting the PS3 handle it.
11:19      velcroshooz | JavaAtom, my tv is pretty old, only supports 720p anyway, so i think it'll be fine. just not to transcode, or send it over the network i think will be an advantage.
11:20         JavaAtom | velcroshooz: Agreed.  When I was playing 720-quality files, it was just plain amazing. I could download, then sit back and watch without a break in between.
11:20         JavaAtom | Especially when I was still on 10/100 network >.>
11:22           milosn | where did /etc/conf.d/mysqld go?

11:24           milosn | and didnt install new one
11:24           milosn | is it no longer supported?
11:24           milosn | to have custom MYSQLD_ROOT?

11:32          FliPPeh | Is there a way to make Bauerbill skip validation checks (md5) for makepkg?
11:34        MrElendig | FliPPeh: no
11:34          FliPPeh | Okay
11:34          FliPPeh | Found a working package anyways
11:34        MrElendig | fix the PKGBUILD instead
11:34        MrElendig | don't ignore errors, fix them
11:35          FliPPeh | I'm not the maintainer.
11:35           wonder | doesn't matter
11:35           wonder | you have the build
11:35          HAL9001 | Hello, so this morning my computer has begun to get kernel panics.  I believe I have narrowed the issue down to the wicd daemon, but I cannot find anywhere in the logs that would confirm this.  How should I go about checking?
11:35          FliPPeh | But no clue how to make packages work
11:36           wonder | makepkg -g
11:36        MrElendig | FliPPeh: it's trivial to update a md5sum
11:36           wonder | to generate md5sums
11:36            Mkman | hey
11:36           wonder | hey
11:36         tigrmesh | hey
11:36         tigrmesh | hey hey hey
11:36        MrElendig | HAL9001: kill it and see if it stops
11:36           wonder | yo yo yo
11:36          HAL9001 | well, I took it out of the deamons array, and they have stopped
11:37          HAL9001 | but I want to find out from the logs why, as I have not updated anything
11:37          HAL9001 | since last night, when it was not happening
11:37        MrElendig | if it still doesn't panic after you bring up the wifi by hand, then there is a high chance that wicd is the problem
11:37        MrElendig | and kernel panics usually don't leave anything in the logs, because of their nature
11:38        MrElendig | since the system can't log anything when the kernel panics :)
11:38          HAL9001 | well that makes sense
11:38        MrElendig | could be a filesystem error
11:38        MrElendig | you could -Syu and reinstall wicd
11:38          HAL9001 | I should do that!
11:39          HAL9001 | if I randomly leave, let it be known that I am about to start wicd!
11:40         sirscott | so i've got a server that functions as an NFS server for my clients' root partitions.  Is there a way to link my home directories on the server to those seen by the clients?  i.e. something like:  ln -s /home/user /nfsroot/home/user?
11:40         sirscott | the problem with that is, when the clients boot, they effectively chroot to /nfsroot/  so the symlink pointing back is invalid
11:40        MrElendig | sirscott: don't link, mount instead
11:41         sirscott | MrElendig: I'd love to, but home is already nfs mounted
11:41          FliPPeh | Hm, I have just installed the Arduino IDE that can upload code to the board, but it can only access the serial port (usb serial port) when ran as root
11:41          FliPPeh | How do I enable it for my non-root user?
11:41        MrElendig | FliPPeh: ls -l the /dev/whatever
11:41        MrElendig | add your user to whatever group that owns it
11:42          FliPPeh | kay...
11:42        MrElendig | if root owns it, poke at the udev rules to make it owned by a different grou0p
11:42          FliPPeh | root uucp
11:42         sirscott | MrElendig: on my server, the /home/ directories are already mounted via aufofs, and I can't just mount them on my clients since my box is serving as a firewall :-/
11:42          HAL9001 | Well son of a bitch
11:42          FliPPeh | My user is part of UUCP
11:42        MrElendig | add your user to uucp then
11:42        MrElendig | and make sure uucp has +rw
11:43          HAL9001 | the second I ran pacman -Syy while wicd was going, it panic'd
11:43          FliPPeh | It has
11:43          FliPPeh | Both given
11:43        MrElendig | then it should work
11:43         -!- paperhats is now known as demantik1
11:43          FliPPeh | Doesn't, tho...
11:43        demantik1 | yo
11:43            td123 | HAL9001: is you wifi using ath9k?
11:43        demantik1 | hi MrElendig
11:43          FliPPeh | Maybe I need to poke around a little
11:43          HAL9001 | no, I saw that thread.  I am using intel 6200
11:43  psychedelicious | anyone know an ftp,archlinux.org mirror with the /other directory?
11:43        MrElendig | FliPPeh: paste the result of 'id'
11:43          HAL9001 | it COULD also be wpa_supplicant
11:44          HAL9001 | because using wicd I was connected to a wpa2, right now an open one
11:44          HAL9001 | I supposed that'd be worrth a try
11:45  psychedelicious | never mind found one
11:45          HAL9001 | so right now I am accessing the same open network that works fine using just iwconfig
11:46          HAL9001 | I'll see if pacman -Syy panics again
11:46          HAL9001 | hmmm, it seems to be related then to wpa2

11:49         JavaAtom | Anyone else seem to notice that newer wifi cards (internal or otherwise) have no issue with wpa/2 but occasionally go wonky when using WEP?
11:49          HAL9001 | I expect to have to reboot!
11:50            faffi | im adding a new partition to my raid array and its coming up as sda2(S)
11:50            faffi | what does the S mean?
11:50          HAL9001 | I have never tried mine with WEP
11:50          HAL9001 | I didn't think anyone still used WEP since it is so easily cracked
11:51            td123 | HAL9001: ppl still use it, because it's still the default on many routers
11:51         JavaAtom | I wasn't saying it wasn't easy to crack, it's just that WEP is -still- the most common around >.>
11:51         JavaAtom | At least, here.
11:57          HAL9001 | dammit
11:57          FliPPeh | MrElendig: It does not list UUCP, but I definitly added myself
11:57        MrElendig | FliPPeh: log out/in
11:57          FliPPeh | Just opening a new ZSH session doesn't update it?
11:58          FliPPeh | Alright then
11:58          HAL9001 | Ok time to try a new network manager to see if it is a problem with the card or wicd
11:59          HAL9001 | I am still very confused though
11:59          HAL9001 | but I am also an idiot
11:59         valhalla | anybody else is having webkit based browsers crashing on almost every webpage?
12:00        MrElendig | no
12:00         valhalla | (I have tried uzbl and arora, chromium does not crash, nor firefox)
12:00           wonder | firefox doesn't use webkit

12:01            jpate | and it's webkit-based
12:01          FliPPeh | Wow
12:01          FliPPeh | Now the GUI ist really effed up

12:01           wonder | valhalla, do you have openjdk installed?
12:02          Frantic | this will sound weird, but how can you see a disks size (non-partitioned)? I used to use cfdisk for this but the machine I'm using now doesn't have it
12:02          Frantic | s/disks/disk's/g
12:02          FliPPeh | Frantic: fdisk
12:02          Frantic | FliPPeh: I tried that, but can't get the disk size anywhere

12:09         valhalla | it's no longer crashing
12:09         valhalla | ok, that means I'm going to need a different browser
12:10        MrElendig | valhalla: you could try jre/jdk instead
12:10        MrElendig | unless you absolutly have to use openjdk
12:11        MrElendig | could also try a newer version of webkit
12:11          FliPPeh | Is it possible to change the default GTK font size for one application only?
12:11        MrElendig | FliPPeh: in teory yes
12:11          FliPPeh | Arduino displays my default of 8 pt with a ridicoulus 2 pt
12:11        MrElendig | can't remember how tho
12:11          FliPPeh | I'd love to set it to like 16
12:12           wonder | valhalla, no you don't. that means that either libwebkit or openjdk are faulty
12:12           wonder | i tend to think that is openjdk
12:13        PyroPeter | oh yes, openjdk is very broken
12:13          FliPPeh | Everything I find in google just want to tell me how to change the font size from code
12:13           wonder | i use jre/jdk
12:13          Omelete | scsi_mod include sata modules too?
12:13       Huulivoide | openjdk is not working in chrome for meneather
12:13           wonder | valhalla, like a workaround, switch to jre/jdk
12:15             tlvb | FliPPeh: if it has a config file for it, probably not from a gnome perspective although I might be wrong
12:19          FliPPeh | tlvb: It has a config file, but you can only change the editor font in there, not the UI
12:20             tlvb | FliPPeh: ah, then I guess it would be about poking about in the sources or if it's libglade based, the proper gui files
12:21         -!- mort_ is now known as mort
12:21          FliPPeh | tlvb: It's JAVA based.
12:21          FliPPeh | That's the root of all problems here
12:22          FliPPeh | Java never plays well with me
12:22             tlvb | my condolences
12:23        Edward226 | hey guys, does fakeroot use sudo?
12:23       Huulivoide | no
12:24       Huulivoide | it doesn't use use sudo
12:24        Pingfloyd | Edward226: no
12:24        Pingfloyd | Edward226: all fakeroot does is what it names implies -- create a fake root-like environment
12:25          FliPPeh | tlvb: I fixed it by killing off java's broken Look and Feel "feature"
12:25          FliPPeh | Now I have native swing graphics
12:26          FliPPeh | Looks ugly, but better than seeing nothing at all...
12:26             tlvb | true
12:27        Pingfloyd | Edward226: there is actually no root access at all going on with fakeroot
12:27           callen | anybody here use private IPs on Arch Linux?
12:27        MrElendig | which is the whole point of it
12:27         valhalla | disabling plugins in arora seems to work as a workaround
12:28           callen | er, private IPs on Linode with an arch linux VPS?
12:28        Pingfloyd | Edward226: a good example is when you're making a package and the make install command is invoked, that's a common place where you would use fakeroot to make sure the output files and dirs have root ownership etc.
12:28        MrElendig | callen: I think ghost does
12:28        MrElendig | iirc
12:29        Edward226 | Pingfloyd yeah thats what I figured, I just didnt want to break something by removing sudo, I dont really plan on using it anymore
12:29           hatten | hmm, after having splitted the screen in screen, switched tty and back, the windows have labels saying 1 bash respective 0 bash. How do I get rid of these labels?
12:29        Pingfloyd | Edward226: if you remove sudo, you'll probably want to make sure you keep su
12:29        MrElendig | Edward226: you won't be able to do makepkg -si :)
12:30        Edward226 | Pingfloyd I think I prefer doing su over sudo. It just seems more secure.
12:31       falconindy | lol, not this again
12:31        Pingfloyd | Edward226: there's a lot of factors when comparing which of those two are more secure
12:32        MrElendig | sudo is good when you don't want to give away your root password to everyone
12:32        Pingfloyd | of give away specific root command to different users
12:32        MrElendig | and when you only want limited access
12:32       falconindy | or when you want to limit root access, or log root-level activity
12:33           amaury | howdy archers
12:33        Pingfloyd | su is fine though where you're the only one on the system that will ever need root access
12:33          keenerd | To be safe, don't give any account with SSH access sudo privledges.
12:33          keenerd | *full sudo privledges
12:33        Pingfloyd | I don't buy ubuntu's FUD against su
12:33          telmich | what's the usual way to contact aur package maintainers? for instance i would like to contact Xavion regarding the puppet package
12:33        Edward226 | Pingfloyd considering I set sudo to use no password on my main user, I think I might as well just do su and do my command list. instead of creating scripts and sudo'ing scripts to su multiple commands.
12:34        MrElendig | telmich: email
12:34          keenerd | telmich: You have to be logged in to see their email.
12:34       falconindy | the only reason for what Ubuntu does is to simplify the experience.. one less password to remember. On the other hand, they've created a society of idiots who eventually believe that sudo is needed for everything
12:34        Pingfloyd | Edward226: if you set no password for a user, you'll of course want to make extra that user has lower risk of being compromised.
12:34          telmich | MrElendig, Electric_Brain: ahh, just seen in the PKGBUILD header
12:34             tlvb | Edward226: that sounds like a bad practice to begin with
12:35        Edward226 | tlvb hense why sudo went bye bye.
12:35        MrElendig | telmich: if you log it, then you can see the email on the aur page too
12:35          telmich | so there's no central bugtracker-thingy for aur (yet)? wouldn't that be a sensible thing?
12:35       falconindy | Edward226: sudo isn't inherently insecure. YOUR usage of it made it insecure.
12:35        Pingfloyd | tlvb: depends how secure you keep the user(s) that isn't required to enter the password
12:35       falconindy | don't blame the program when you misuse it.
12:35          keenerd | telmich: Nope.  Report bugs in the comments.
12:35             tlvb | Edward226: why not set up sudo to have noposswd on /those specific scripts/ instead?
12:35          telmich | keenerd: ahh, ok
12:35        Pingfloyd | tlvb: besides, if that user is compromised to where the attacker knows that user's password, prompting for a password for sudo is a moot point anyway.
12:36         valhalla | Pingfloyd: you mean that it is on an unconnected box in a bunker? then it may be secure enought
12:36        MrElendig | telmich: that is one of the ideas regarding aur2
12:36         -!- xenor_ is now known as xenor
12:36        Edward226 | tlvb its easier to just su > run script. I make them on the fly.
12:36          keenerd | That said, most centralized systems die with 20 thousand devs.
12:37        Pingfloyd | valhalla: that's being kind of simplistic about things
12:37           hatten | lol, I got a file named -n in my ~, how the hell do I remove it? \, ", or ' doesn't work
12:37        MrElendig | --
12:37        MrElendig | man rm
12:37         valhalla | hatten: haave you tried with rm -- -n
12:37           hatten | aha, thx
12:37        Pingfloyd | some users can think beyond, "ubuntu told me su is bad"
12:37        MrElendig | hatten: please start RTFM
12:37             tlvb | Pingfloyd: true, but there is a difference in the attacs that do not use an explicit login
12:37        MrElendig | hatten: the rm man page have that as an example
12:37        Pingfloyd | tlvb: yeah, and that's the only difference
12:38             tlvb | Edward226: sudo -s
12:38        MrElendig | start to*
12:38           hatten | MrElendig: sure, I was just inherently surprised that \ didn't work
12:38        MrElendig | why would it
12:38         valhalla | hatten: \ protects the - from the shell, not from the program
12:38        MrElendig | - has no special meaning
12:38   Electric_Brain | hi, flash in uzbl it's not working (It's installed through pacman -S flashplugin and in firefox it works) any idea why it's not working?
12:38           hatten | because it negates other weird characters
12:38        Pingfloyd | tlvb: besides, if an attacker gained access to a user with any sort of ability to use root access, I would consider the system compromised
12:38           callen | MrElendig: thanks, is he here? tab-completion isn't showing me him.
12:38          telmich | puppet and archlinux is indeed a very interesting topic, as neither archlinux nor puppet do integrate each other well currently
12:38           hatten | valhalla: aha, didn't knew that one
12:39          keenerd | Pingfloyd: Like I said, use a non-SSH account for sudo.
12:39        MrElendig | callen: nope, havn't seen him for a couple of days
12:39           callen | damn.
12:39        Pingfloyd | tlvb: that is why one should never use their sudoer users to do things that are higher risk for security
12:39        Edward226 | tlvb I am not talking about things I do all the time, I just used to do su in slackware and had an argument with a friend about sudo. I've been using sudo out of being lazy and not typing the password at all. its insecure and I would rather just use su when I need to do something with root.
12:39           callen | MrElendig: linode provide's private IPs, but only one interface. have to use an aliased interface.
12:39           callen | provides, wtf apostrophe.
12:40        Edward226 | Pingfloyd I was thinking of making another user to do things like that, but then whats the point if its not really much easier and takes more typing :P
12:40        Pingfloyd | tlvb: it is better to make a specific user with very limited access for when you need to do things that increase security risk
12:40             tlvb | Edward226: well, then that is a problem with your laziness and not sudo vs su :p
12:41             tlvb | Pingfloyd: I'm not arguing with that
12:41            td123 | tlvb: if you are dealing high security risks, you shouldn't be relying solely on sudo :S
12:41        Edward226 | tlvb I wasnt dissing su or sudo. I was just saying I think using su is more my style.
12:41        MrElendig | callen: you will have to use a static ip setup
12:41             tlvb | td123: I am not
12:42           callen | MrElendig: that much was clear, and I've configured it. the aliased interface shows up in ifconfig. doesn't appear to be otherwise working though.
12:42        MrElendig | callen: http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Configuring_network#IP_aliasing  should work afaik
12:42            phrik | Title: Configuring Network - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
12:42           callen | MrElendig: I can ping my own private IP, nothing else appears to work.
12:42           callen | MrElendig: yes that's the documentation I'd already been working from.
12:42        MrElendig | hm, remembered to set up a route and add the dns?
12:42           callen | route yes, dns no.
12:42           callen | the dns was already set up.
12:42        Pingfloyd | me neither, I'm not dissing su or sudo either, but trying to point out that security is very relative.
12:43           callen | I didn't touch it beyond that, do I need to do something special?
12:43        MrElendig | check /etc/resolv.conf
12:43        Pingfloyd | I use them both actually
12:43           callen | MrElendig: looks pretty sundry to me.
12:43        MrElendig | 109.74.192.20 109.74.193.20 109.74.194.20  or whatever in there?
12:43        Edward226 | Pingfloyd maybe Ill set it up so sudo is passworded so if its just 1 command Ill sudo, if more ill su
12:43           callen | MrElendig: yes.
12:43           callen | MrElendig: I can't ping broadcast or the .1
12:44        MrElendig | hm, should work then :/
12:44           callen | that's what fails.
12:44        Pingfloyd | Edward226: you can of course opt to do sudo -i instead of su as well
12:44        MrElendig | strange
12:45           callen | MrElendig: I'm asking the #linode people. Doubt I'll get much though.
12:45           callen | I'm trying to see if there's a way to test the interface and get an ICMP response.
12:46           callen | yeah, nothing. they're dead.
12:46           callen | I'm just going to configure another server and hope for the rest, I don't really have any choice.
12:48        MrElendig | hm, ghost was last on Apr 23 04:08:24 2010 (12 hours, 37 minutes, 32 seconds ago)
12:48           callen | MrElendig: I'll just charge forth, get another VPS setup for private IPs, and start banging packets between the two of them.
12:48           callen | I'm hoping I don't have to do a lot of retarded manual route setting.
12:50          telmich | wow, there's a lot going on on aur-general
12:58        firecat53 | any x86_64 users out there who'd be able to install wkhtmltopdf-static from aur and see if it segfaults on your system too? I'm downloading the source now to recompile qt for it, but I'd rather not if someone has any ideas.
12:59        MrElendig | øbuilding from sources is always prefered
12:59        firecat53 | heh -- old computer -- qt -- ugh <see you in a few hours>
12:59      keiichidono | Any mods here?
13:00        MrElendig | keiichidono: yes, several
13:00        MrElendig | how may we abuse you?
13:00      keiichidono | I don't see them as OPs, can you point me to them?
13:01        MrElendig | keiichidono: I am a op in this channel
13:01             tlvb | keiichidono: they gain ophood when needed afaik
13:02        MrElendig | keiichidono: use /query instead of dcc
13:02        MrElendig | I do not accept dcc

13:13      binarycodes | whoa LFS!! who needs that headache
13:14            axion | its only a headache for those that havent read the book
13:14             Hund | tlvb: Havent tried the manual way. Dont think it will work if I cant restart the network.
13:15             tlvb | Hund: but it might shed some light as to what part is failing
13:16             Hund | tlvb: Give me a sec then.

13:41             tlvb | Hund: I guess so, and the staticness of the ip is just in the contract between you and the isp, but as I said, my knowledge about it pretty much ends there
13:42             tlvb | Hund: do you get any other output except from the final 'timed out' when trying to dhcpcd?

13:53        MrElendig | disable kms
13:53        JiminyJew | kms?
13:53        MrElendig | and kill off the nvidia drivers
13:53        MrElendig | tho they should't cause a panic
13:53        JiminyJew | I have deleted just about everything called nvidia
13:53        MrElendig | unless maybe if you are explicitly loading them
13:54        JiminyJew | I dont think so
13:54        JiminyJew | and I even blacklisted nvidia in rc.conf
13:54        JiminyJew | now...this kms

13:57        JiminyJew | one weird thing tho.
13:57        JiminyJew | in /lib/udev
13:57        JiminyJew | there's a load-modules.sh
13:57        JiminyJew | the first line had nvidia in it
13:57        JiminyJew | nvidia!#bin-bash etc
13:57        JiminyJew | I deleted the whole line
13:58        JiminyJew | instead of the word nvidia
13:58        JiminyJew | and it booted with vesa
13:58        JiminyJew | but it didnt detect my usb devices
13:58        JiminyJew | so I couldn't use it
13:58        JiminyJew | any clue why that would happen?
13:58             Hund | tlvb: LOL
13:58             tlvb | Hund: ?
13:59             Hund | tlvb: I just ran dhcpcd again to show what it said and it gave me my IP back again. :P
13:59             tlvb | Hund: nice

14:00             tlvb | Hund: no problem

14:25         davekong | Edward226: ?
14:25       CryptoMole | I am not opposed to new ideas
14:26           wonder | i am!
14:26        MrElendig | I'm only opposed to stupid ideas
14:26           wonder | what idea?:D
14:26        LugarSivi | can I have some advice on ext3 filesystem... I'm in dillema to use data=journal or data=orderer
14:26           hatten | I am strongly against new ideas that I don't like
14:26        MrElendig | LugarSivi: if in doubt, don't touch it
14:26        Edward226 | such as a front end to pacman, I know people say blah blah libalpm but it seems like too much work. wonder a better way to check dependencies and such. basically something like aptitude is to apt-get
14:26           wonder | Edward226, great idea. do it
14:26       CryptoMole | I come up with idea all the time but I dont have money to put into action.
14:27        Edward226 | I dont want to reinvent the wheel, just pretty up the outputs of a lot of stuff.
14:27         davekong | wonder: ++
14:27           hatten | Edward226: uhh yaourt? if you want pretty colors?
14:27        MrElendig | Edward226: aptitude does not wrap apt-get afaik, it uses the lib instead
14:27        LugarSivi | MrElendig: I think thats bad advice because new kernels use writeback which is worst option of these 2
14:27           wonder | Edward226, also there are a lot of graphical frontends
14:27         davekong | Edward226: have you seen clyde?
14:27        MrElendig | LugarSivi: then you know what to do

14:28           wonder | Edward226, so start doing one or you want that frontend to be official supported?
14:28           barzam | I never even realised pacman was any worse than aptitude/apt-get

14:28         davekong | Edward226: Edward226 clyde is not abs
14:28        MrElendig | Edward226: btw, what do you miss when it comes to dependency handeling in pacman?
14:28        Edward226 | wonder well i AM GONNA MAKE ONE.

14:28     sledgehammer | vinvin, welcome to last month :P
14:28           hatten | I thought it fitted with caps there =D
14:29         davekong | Edward226: clyde does not try to be abs
14:29           vinvin | indeed, it's been months since i used this system
14:29           barzam | hatten: yeah me too
14:29        MrElendig | vinvin: stop doing -Sy stuff, start doing -Syu && -S stuff
14:29        Edward226 | imho clyde just makes things harder than abs does by trying to make it easier
14:29        MrElendig | vinvin: to solve your current dilemma; symlink, -Syu, remove the symlink
14:29       CryptoMole | I dont think advokating bsd and thier lic. which is not Gnu in here is cool
14:29           vinvin | MrElendig: symlink what to what?
14:29       CryptoMole | bsd is not Linux
14:30        MrElendig | vinvin: asuming you are getting "libfoo not found"
14:30           vinvin | yes
14:30           barzam | CryptoMole: why not? gnu is not linux either btw

14:31           vinvin | oh that's that simple
14:31           barzam | CryptoMole: the way I see it Linux is a lot more than the kernel

14:31        Edward226 | vinvin I never said really complex, I said make the output of certain things better lol

14:32           barzam | that*

14:46           vinvin | MrElendig: yes i did think about it, thanks anyway :)
14:46        MrElendig | leaking*
14:46        timofonic | Please, some help? I need to hear the radio program from a good friend :(
14:46            Dblur | !rules
14:46            phrik | Go here >> http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IRC_Channel << for the channel rules/guidelines, and other useful information.
14:46      velcroshooz | keenerd, it is in aur as well, i just installed from there.
14:46        Edward226 | yeah I can tell by that screen shot its not what I want. thanks.
14:46            Dblur | hello.
14:47            Dblur | is there any weekly builds ?
14:47        MrElendig | Edward226: it can also make images like http://www.abclinuxu.cz/data/prilohy/2/9/145492-mc-deps-19138.png
14:47           barzam | build of what?
14:47        Edward226 | MrElendig but I dont want just an output
14:47        MrElendig | then what do you want
14:47        timofonic | Dblur: Archlinux is getting updated more often than others
14:47        timofonic | Dblur: It gets
14:47            Dblur | archlinux-2009.08-core-i686.iso is the latest atm?
14:48        MrElendig | Dblur: arch is rolling release, so no, there is no weekly builds
14:48          keenerd | Edward226: Or if you want something fancier, Pacgraph: http://kmkeen.redraftable.com/pacgraph/gimp.png
14:48        timofonic | Dblur: I mean it's not the classic distro stabilizing packages per certain stages like Debian
14:48           barzam | Dblur: install it and update and you have the latest of everything
14:48        timofonic | Edward226: It's more in the edge
14:48            Dblur | isnt there any way to get the latest packages for an offline installation
14:48        MrElendig | Dblur: http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=94687
14:48            Dblur | ?
14:48            phrik | Title: Arch Linux Forums / New testing builds (at bbs.archlinux.org)
14:48        MrElendig | Dblur: use those images
14:48        Edward226 | I want to make something that aptitude does for apt-get. a nice little cli type gui that makes pacman easier to use.
14:49        MrElendig | Edward226: pyalpmm + ncurses
14:49        MrElendig | go!
14:49           barzam | Edward226: I think it's a great idea, why don't you start right away?
14:50        MrElendig | Dblur: read this: http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=18063
14:50        timofonic | MrElendig: Python isn't little :P
14:50            phrik | Title: Arch Linux Forums / The Rolling Release System (at bbs.archlinux.org)
14:50        MrElendig | timofonic: the python language is tiny
14:50          keenerd | MrElendig: Not our version.  It depends on Perl.
14:50        timofonic | MrElendig: That's funny, the package for is is HUGE
14:50        MrElendig | timofonic: I said 'the language'
14:51        timofonic | MrElendig: Even that, it's like Java. It has tons of libs
14:51            Dblur | would archlinux-2010.04.05-core-x86_64.iso be what i would get after an pacman -Syu on archlinux-2009.08-core-x86_64.iso  ?
14:51        timofonic | MrElendig: But well, it's more modular
14:51        MrElendig | timofonic: the standard lib in cpython (which is just one of many python implimentations) are quite extensive tho
14:51        timofonic | MrElendig: I see
14:51          keenerd | timofonic: They are culling dying libs in Py3k.
14:51        timofonic | Ok
14:51           hatten | Dblur: the installer would be different on the live system, but the installed system will be identical
14:51        timofonic | Anyway, that's offtopic
14:51        MrElendig | Dblur: no
14:52        timofonic | Please, some help with the ALSA problem?
14:52        MrElendig | Dblur: read the last link I gave you
14:52        MrElendig | Dblur: arch has no releases
14:52        MrElendig | timofonic: no, because you havn't told anyone what the problem is :)
14:53           barzam | Dblur: maybe checkout archbang, if you won't have internet access with the system
14:53          rschnck | Hmm. How well do you think a VM with Win 7 on a T410s with an i5-520M, 4GB of RAM, and an X18-M will perform?
14:53           vinvin | that's crazy, i upgraded for 1.5GB and after reboot everything still works, it was very unusual few months ago with vmware and xorg at least
14:53          rschnck | And how much space do you guys reckon it will take up O.O
14:53        MrElendig | rschnck: depends on what vm you are running, and what effects you enable in win7
14:54         genoclde | Oh wow this is really wierd
14:54        MrElendig | !give vinvin wiki pacnew
14:54            phrik | vinvin: Pacnew and Pacsave Files - ArchWiki: <http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacnew_and_Pacsave_Files>
14:54        MrElendig | vinvin: you want to do that ^
14:54        timofonic | MrElendig: That's why I ask. Mplayer can't find the mixer it says
14:54            Dblur | barzam : i dont need openbox ty :)
14:54        MrElendig | timofonic: pastebin the whole output
14:54        MrElendig | timofonic: from mplayer -ao alsa anythingwithsound
14:54          rschnck | MrElendig: screw any sort of effects. I'm unsure what I would be running...I'm going to be a physics major in college and I'm guessing at some point I may need software that only exists in Win/Mac
14:55          rschnck | So maybe some sort of graphing software, or data-grabbing software.
14:55        MrElendig | those things can usually be done without relying on windows
14:55          rschnck | Yes, I know. Usually math/science-based programs are written for Linux as well.
14:55          rschnck | But if I'm going to have a copy of Windows 7, I might as well.
14:56        MrElendig | python is actually quite popular for those tasks
14:56            qotsa | i'm looking for something like zenity that can handle forms. (not only single entry fields like zenity does)
14:56          keenerd | rschnck: Unless you must use Simulink for an assignment, you probably won't need windows.
14:56            Dblur | aha
14:56            GiZme | is there anything special you need to do to get the ssh server to accept pub key authentication?
14:56          rschnck | Hmm.
14:56            Dblur | thats for that link , its clear now.
14:56            Dblur | thanks*
14:56          rschnck | I'm going to replace my CD-drive with a 750GB 2.5" drive...and since it's so huge, I can't see the disadvantage to plop Windows on htere.
14:56          rschnck | Just in case.
14:56         genoclde | <rschnck> yea it isn't a bad idea to have windows 7 as my backup
14:57           hatten | rschnck: windows is always a disadvantage
14:57            Sagan | does anyone here use eix ?
14:57        MrElendig | qotsa: pyqy!
14:57          rschnck | hatten: Har har.
14:57         takeshi- | Hi all i have a netbook with arch, all go fine, but with the kernel-netbook the sound doesnt works
14:57          rschnck | I haven't used it in over a year. I don't know--I don't really want to taint my computer with it.
14:57          rschnck | I suppose if I have a task that requires Win/Mac I could just use school PCs.
14:57        MrElendig | qotsa: it's really really easy to use, even if you know next to nothing about python
14:57         takeshi- | but with the kernel ARCH i have it
14:58          rschnck | CHOICES.
14:58        MrElendig | qotsa: the UI design is drag and drop
14:58            Dblur | would you guys recommend arch to be used as a media streaming server
14:58            Dblur | or any kind of server...
14:58         takeshi- | anyone have an idea where i can check for a solution?
14:58            qotsa | MrElendig: you mean pyQt?
14:58        MrElendig | Dblur: arch can be used for anything
14:58            Dblur | or should i use gentoo or debian linux ?
14:58           barzam | Dblur: yes, arch is a great distro
14:58        MrElendig | qotsa: yea, just a typo
14:58            Dblur | no, i mean with the bleeding edge packages wouldnt there be a higher security risk ?
14:59        MrElendig | Dblur: yes and no
14:59           hatten | rschnck: yeah, I thought "why not put windows on my computer" I spent a few hours trying to get it working, never got internet working in the end (after searching like 20 driver CD's) and now it takes up half of my hdd. I've never booted it and I'll remove it once I remember it when rebooting.
14:59        MrElendig | Dblur: being up to date means that we don't have to backport 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 security fixes to older software
14:59        MrElendig | Dblur: unlike eg debian
14:59        MrElendig | Dblur: if you are paranoid about security tho, then use openbsd
14:59        Edward226 | hatten why do you have to reboot to remove it?
14:59            qotsa | MrElendig: I actually use python, but for this single gui dialog that i nee Qt is kind of an overkill, but I will have a look at it.
14:59            Dblur | what about openbsd?
15:00           hatten | Edward226: well, if I would repartition
15:00          rschnck | hatten: Okay. My computer comes with a 1.8" HDD that I won't use anyway, and it's stock-loaded with Windows. If I REALLY needed it, I suppose I could swap my SSD out and use it temporarily.
15:00         *          Dblur goes to check openbsd
15:00          rschnck | No windows, then :)
15:00           hatten | rschnck: that sounds like a good idea
15:00           barzam | Dblur: I think you ought to use whatever you feel most comfortable with, probably you won't ever need to worry about security on a media streaming server or a private server
15:01        Edward226 | hatten I see.
15:01        MrElendig | qotsa: a simple text input box is only like 6 loc :)
15:02        Edward226 | Dblur there are things you can do to archlinux to make it so the bleeding edge doesnt break your system.
15:02        Edward226 | Dblur that is if you are even planning on using X.
15:02        timofonic | Here it is the mplayer output, hope it is useful :)    http://paste.archlinux-br.org/1501

15:03            Dblur | im not gona be using X
15:03            Dblur | just gona need to install openssh and java after isntallation
15:03          keenerd | Pacmatic is useful for not breaking your system.
15:03            Dblur | just need to find the right distro.
15:03        MrElendig | timofonic: looks like your alsa setup is crap
15:03         *          Dblur doesnt feel like installation debian stable like always
15:03        MrElendig | timofonic: try removing asoundrc and running alsaconfig
15:07        timofonic | MrElendig: Where's asoundrc?
15:07           hatten | when a site offers *.tar.gz downloads, is that for pacman?

15:35        timofonic | I'm having a weird headache, need to rest. See you all
15:35        timofonic | hatten: Uh? Oh ok
15:35           hatten | lol
15:35           hatten | I can see that you have a headache
15:35        timofonic | hatten: Seriously, my health is not good now :P
15:35           hatten | you're asking me if I know myself and get surprised when I am
15:35        timofonic | hatten: Hope to recover
15:35           hatten | well goodnigt then
15:35        timofonic | hatten: I wasn't trying to say that...
15:36        timofonic | hatten: Going th hear the radio program of a friend... :P
15:36        timofonic | hatten: See you, thanks
15:36           hatten | cya
15:40          Laeborg | Can I make a script there runs pacman -Suy on bootup, just after it have startet the network daemon and before it loads kde?
15:41          ismael1 | hi
15:41          ismael1 | empathy don't work, I can choose my account :(
15:41       falconindy | Laeborg: you could add it to /etc/rc.local
15:41          ismael1 | : empathy_accounts_dialog_show_application: Launching empathy-accounts (if_needed: 0, hidden: 0, account: <none selected>)
15:41       falconindy | Laeborg: you'd be advised not to do that, though
15:42          Laeborg | okay, how come?
15:42         -!- ealexp is now known as ealexp__
15:43           hatten | well, if you boot once a month you will have a horribly outdated system
15:43       falconindy | well for starters, it's never going to do anything without --no-confirm
15:43           hatten | ;D
15:43       falconindy | secondly, you should actively know what's being updated
15:43          Laeborg | it wont show that?
15:44             Mion | Laeborg: it is a really bad idea
15:44           hatten | well, in the log
15:44          Laeborg | Ah okay ;)
15:44           hatten | although you could do one thing
15:44         Kovensky | which IRC clients support real perl scripting?
15:44       falconindy | dare i say "most" archers probably have 'pacman -Sy' in a cron job and use some sort of script to detect when new updates are available
15:44           hatten | you make it spawn a terminal, where -Syu is launched
15:44         Kovensky | only xchat, weechat and irssi?
15:44             Mion | Laeborg: because one day it will break your system and you will go "wtf" and not understand why it won't boot
15:44           hatten | falconindy: nope, you don't.
15:45             Mion | Kovensky: perl
15:45       falconindy | hatten: im daring a guy, what can i say
15:45       falconindy | er
15:45             Mion | Kovensky: as in perl itself
15:45       falconindy | freudian, much? im a daring guy ><
15:45       falconindy | but yeah... cron job, etc etc, profit
15:45         Kovensky | (as in one that you can bind commands and respond to events)
15:45         Kovensky | though I guess the "respond to events" part isn't very necessary since I can make the bouncer do that
15:45         Kovensky | Mion: duh :P
15:45           hatten | "export DISPLAY=:0 && xterm -e sudo pacman -Syu" could work, and there's nothing dangerous
15:45         Kovensky | Mion: which do you like more, Coro::AnyEvent + AnyEvent::IRC or POE::Component::IRC? :P
15:46             Mion | none of them
15:46             Mion | I prefer python
15:46         Kovensky | D:
15:46       falconindy | hatten: no need for the &&... just DISPLAY=:0 sudo pacm....
15:46         Kovensky | I can work with python but I don't like it much :(
15:46         Kovensky | my current affair is with perl
15:46         Kovensky | <3
15:46           hatten | falconindy: aha
15:52       silvernode | Hey guys what happened to shaman? It doesn't seem to be in the x86 or the x86_64 repos.
15:52       falconindy | shaman is in the AUR
15:53             tigr | you'll find it in the chakra project / kdemod
15:53        demantik1 | huuuuurd
15:53       silvernode | Really? Could have sworn I check the AUR. Oh well I'll check again
15:54         Kovensky | chakra... reminds me of ophion ._.
15:54         Kovensky | (or, how I got to know about arch)
15:56       silvernode | lol shaman is out of date
15:56       silvernode | figured it would be
15:57       silvernode | Probably why it was put in the AUR.
15:59           hatten | gaaah, I have shitloads of anime on my comp that I wanna see, but I have no time for it >_<
15:59             Mion | hatten: I can ban you from there, then you will have plenty of time
15:59           hatten | kirby, bleach, gantz
15:59           hatten | Mion: hmm, tempting
16:00             Mion | start with watching garden of sinners, shangri la  and eve no jikan
16:00           Arkham | hatten: find . -iname "*anime*" | xargs rm -i
16:00             ldvx | haha
16:00             Mion | Arkham: usless pipe and xarg usage
16:00           hatten | Arkham: oh, what does that do
16:00           Arkham | Mion: xargs is awesome
16:00         *         hatten goes to test
16:00             Mion | Arkham: man find, see what -delete does
16:00           hatten | haha
16:00        silentivm | find . -iname anime -delete
16:00           Arkham | Mion: although delete is integrated
16:00             Mion | Arkham: alternative, -exec
16:00        silentivm | that is better
16:00           Arkham | exec sucks
16:00             ldvx | hatten: don't watch bleach! it's been nothing but fillers (except for the last episode)
16:01          tntcoda | With Arch inside virutalbox, do i want to use the vesa video dirver?
16:01       falconindy | find . -iname '*anime*' -ok -delete
16:01           Arkham | tntcoda: do you?
16:01             Yumi | reuh
16:01             Mion | Arkham: pft -exec  + owns
16:01           hatten | actually, nothing will be deleted if I run that
16:01           Arkham | Mion: w
16:01           hatten | none of the anime is on this comp
16:01          tntcoda | Arkham, yes, do I
16:01           hatten | it's all on my fileserver =D
16:01           Arkham | tntcoda: that's yourt answer!
16:01          tntcoda | Arkham, thanks for the help
16:01        silentivm | :D
16:02           Arkham | :D
16:02          Blaargh | you might want the vbox driver tntcoda
16:02         -!- David is now known as Guest68576
16:02             Mion | Arkham: -exec command {} +  does more or less what xargs does, but it's faster
16:03          tntcoda | Blaargh, thanks I couldnt find it, I was wondering if thats installed in as the guest tools or if there is a pre made driver
16:03             Mion | Arkham: there is also -execdir which can be really handy
16:03          Blaargh | nope,comes with the guest tools
16:03           Arkham | Mion: are you a surrogate of man find?
16:03           Arkham | :P
16:03             Mion | nop
16:04             Mion | the man page has additional info
16:04           Arkham | omgitcan'tbe!
16:05         Kovensky | alternatively
16:05         Kovensky | sudo zfs destroy $HOME/Anime
16:05         *       Kovensky runs
16:05         davekong | If I want a drop in Linux replace for the proprietary turbo assembler or at least an assembler that uses the same source what would it be?
16:06           Arkham | a great reply for anyone who uses the "useless use of $stuff" phrase is "dude, you're using flash for videos!"
16:06         Kovensky | hatten: heh, I'm also setting up a fileserver here
16:06         Kovensky | hatten: still using sshfs and rsync to move stuff around though ._.
16:06         Kovensky | will set up NFS when I unlazy
16:07           hatten | Kovensky: hah, I'm not even using rsync =D
16:08         Kovensky | nah, I'm still moving stuff from my craptop to the fileserver
16:08         Kovensky | I finished installing it yesterday lol
16:08           hatten | Kovensky: although the coolest is to mount with sshfs and then watch it directly with mplayer, without moving the files to this comp
16:08         Kovensky | I like rsync because I get a cute progress display ._.
16:08         Kovensky | hatten: yes, that's what I'm doing with what's already moved; but I intend to change to NFSv4 later
16:09           hatten | Kovensky: reason?
16:09         Kovensky | sshfs uses more CPU, and I don't have much to afford :)
16:09           hatten | aha
16:09         davekong | better question... what is the best x86 assembler for Linux?
16:09         Kovensky | yasm
16:09           hatten | Kovensky: on which comp?
16:09         Kovensky | craptop
16:09         Kovensky | T2370 :(
16:10         Kovensky | though the biggest responsible for the CPU burn is my video chip (sis)
16:10           hatten | Kovensky: okay, but it's nice to the host?
16:10         davekong | Kovensky: thanks
16:11         Kovensky | hatten: the host isn't doing much for now besides compiling ports and serving files
16:11         Kovensky | but it's a single processor sempron 2800+ ._.
16:12         pingveno | I just did a pacman -Syu and saw that pm-utils now has an option upower dependency. What does it do?
16:12           hatten | Kovensky: mine's bittorrenting and storing files, an old comp I got from school
16:12         Kovensky | it's probably using some CPU though because I'm using full ZFS in it
16:12         Kovensky | and I enabled compression on o9k places

10:45         androide | hello there, im using chromium-browser-bin Version        : 33168-1
10:45              gjl | is tiling becoming mainstream?
10:45         androide | i used to log into some forum
10:46         androide | but with chromium or firefox cant keep logged
10:46         androide | with opera works fine
10:46         helgikrs | huh, guess that gives me a reason to try kde4.5 someday
10:46         androide | but i'm kinda used to chromium :\
10:46         androide | how i can fix this?
10:46         androide | the SSL is active on the chromium options
10:52        cantabile | I just used clyde to update clyde. What are these supposed to mean?
10:52           daedra | is there any such online service where you can give someone a unique link, they click on it, you exchange unique keys, and can then talk over SSL through your browser?

10:56          nikki93 | Hey guys! How do I add /usr/local/bin to the '.so' search path? I just wrote a program, and it's failing to find the '.so's local, but it can find those in /usr/lib
10:56          nikki93 | I mean, /usr/local/lib sorry.
10:56     sledgehammer | nikki93, /etc/ld.so.conf
10:56          nikki93 | I see. I just list the directories in that/
10:56        MrElendig | cantabile: they mean exactly what it says. It's skipping clyde-git-20100423-1 because 20100426-1 exist and is in the target list
10:57          nikki93 | Actually I'll read about it on the internet, thanks! :D
10:57     sledgehammer | nikki93, great idea! :)
10:58          nikki93 | Yeah i usually do that, just that 'ld .so search path' didn't give much on google.
10:58          nikki93 | 'ld so conf' gave quite a lot though. ^_^
10:59        cantabile | MrElendig: and this 'target list' is whatever I type after 'clyde -S' ?
10:59           daedra | is there any such online service where you can give someone a unique link, they click on it, you exchange unique keys, and can then talk over SSL through your browser?
11:00         johndarc | I already am in the group power, but I don't have permission to shutdown, reboot, sleep or hibernate, only to logout. What should I do?
11:00         johndarc | 2~DE is xfce4.
11:01           Maltin | johndarc: hint: hal-policies
11:02         johndarc | I don't have HAL installed
11:02           Arkham | johndarc: aww
11:03         johndarc | Maltin: I don't have no /etc/hal/
11:03           Maltin | johndarc: i see :)
11:04         johndarc | all right then :) hold on
11:04         johndarc | thank you, you have been very helpful
11:04           Maltin | johndarc: how should xfce turn off your system w/o hal?
11:04         johndarc | that's one of the reasons I need hal, then?
11:05           Maltin | i think so
11:05     sledgehammer | daedra, use gpg with a public key server. Don't know about chatting through your browser though
11:05            Janno | poweroff command needs hal? O_o
11:05         johndarc | can't I just give it permission to exec /sbin/shutdown
11:05           Maltin | poweroff from X
11:05           daedra | sledgehammer: thought so
11:06           Maltin |  Shutting down and rebooting from withing Xfce
11:06           Maltin | * Make sure that dbus and hal are enabled in the DAEMONS array in /etc/rc.conf.

11:09         johndarc | Thank you very much, guys. It works now after starting dbus and hal. ANother question, why do I need pulseaudio if my audio works perfectly with oss alone?
11:09          gnubien | johndarc: pulseaudio is optional, not necessary
11:10            Janno | !pulseaudio
11:10            phrik | do we really need this? http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/linuxaudio.png
11:10         -!- root is now known as Guest75492
11:10           Maltin | johndarc: one question: how do you handle your input devices without HAL?
11:10         johndarc | xorg 1.8.0
11:10            Janno | udev <3
11:10         johndarc | udev, I guess?
11:10              OEP | Each time I reboot, my system always has the time five hours exactly behind real time. ntpd isn't autostarting (it is in DAEMONS, can't see it from ps). ntpd corrects it when I manually start. Any ideas about this?
11:10           Maltin | ok
11:11         johndarc | !pulseaudio
11:11            phrik | do we really need this? http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/linuxaudio.png
11:11         johndarc | Janno: oh, right, I guess that's a "no" to my previous question.
11:12           Maltin | johndarc: do you start alsa via rc.conf?
11:12         johndarc | not alsa, but oss
11:12         johndarc | yes.
11:12           Maltin | ah ok
11:12         johndarc | should I start it with the @ prefix?
11:12           Maltin | nope
11:12           Maltin | wouldn't fix it
11:12           Arkham | OEP: are you backgrounding ntpd?
11:13              OEP | Arkham: nope. should I be?
11:13         johndarc | I am not having any problems so far. The only problem is that virtualbox doesn't support xorg 1.8.0, but that is unrelated, I am growing the experience to move to Arch soon.
11:14           Arkham | OEP: i remember there were problems when backgrounding ntp
11:14              OEP | Arkham: I'm not sure I wholly understand the difference between "backgrounding" and "running as daemon". I see there is an annotation for it in rc.conf, but I don't know what it does! :P
11:15              OEP | this system has a non-permanent network connection -- it's a laptop normally on wireless
11:15         johndarc | "at" symbol (@), then it will be executed in the background, i.e. the startup sequence will not wait for successful completion before continuing.
11:15         johndarc | OEP:
11:16              OEP | johndarc: OK, so I won't see the FAILED on startup if it does fail
11:16         johndarc | http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/DAEMONS#Starting_Daemons_in_Background

11:16           busata | johndarc: virtualbox doesn't support xorg 1.8?
11:16         johndarc | I guess I should be backgrounding oss then?
11:16              OEP | Crystal clear. Thanks.
11:16           busata | virtualbox seems to work just fine here
11:16         johndarc | busata: no :P
11:16         johndarc | oh as guest
11:17           busata | ah
11:17         johndarc | it has no modules for xorg 1.8.0 as guest
11:17           busata | like that :) ok, ignore meh!
11:17           Maltin | johndarc: backgrounding a daemon cannot fix your problem
11:17         johndarc | Maltin: what problem am I having?
11:17           busata | I now had to hear the horrible windows start up sound, again! quickly shuts it down
11:18           Maltin | lol
11:18           Maltin | johndarc: i thougth your sound is broken?
11:18           Arkham | windows are nice
11:18         johndarc | no, it's just that every guide tells me to install pulseaudio
11:18           Arkham | they let the light in
11:18         johndarc | but the sound is working perfectly fine without pulseaudio.
11:18           Maltin | johndarc: aw ok. shame on me :)
11:19         johndarc | :)
11:19           Maltin | then you should probably background it
11:22         johndarc | oh, nice, xfce needs HAL to automount things automatically. I guess that fixes another doubt I was having
11:23           Arkham | doesn't xorg need hal anyway?
11:24           busata | 1.8 doesn't
11:24           Arkham | cute
11:24           busata | trying to see here as well if I can do without hal
11:24           busata | just the automounting left
11:24           Arkham | but xorg 1.8 is in the repos?
11:24           busata | there's a seperate repo for it, seperated from testing
11:24           Arkham | I see
11:26         johndarc | is it safer to su root everytime or to install sudo?
11:27               nn | i need to setup automounting and jack still today
11:29          daevski | johndarc, I think su root is safer, but less convenient.
11:29          daevski | johndarc, just as long as you never share your root pass..... in that situation, ust install sudo.
11:30         johndarc | can't a user use sudo to change root's password?
11:30         johndarc | sudo passwd root?
11:32               nn | You can restrict commands a user can use (tho they could always write their own if u allowed that)
11:33           Arkham | johndarc: if sudo is configured to run any command
11:33           Arkham | you can type sudo su
11:33           Arkham | then passwd
11:35      DigitalKiwi | cantabile: it means i might tweak how it decides what to install
11:35        MrElendig | johndarc: don't give the user unlimited sudo access
11:35         Wraithan | My friends! I am for the first time, trying to setup a multiple gateway routing setup between my computers
11:36        Animeking | !phrik
11:36            phrik | Do I look like a butler to you?
11:36        Animeking | Okay my net works
11:36        Animeking | :P
11:36        cantabile | DigitalKiwi: (in this case) what is there to decide? Should it not grab the latest version available in git?
11:36      DigitalKiwi | it does grab the latest version in git
11:37      DigitalKiwi | the thing is how it matches what to install
11:37         Wraithan | At work we have a wired network that sucks, and a wireless one that doesn't suck, so I want my laptop on the wireless but I need my desktop on the wired to access network resources. I want to have them connected via synergy so I tossed a network cable between my laptop and my desktop (desktop has 2 NICs)
11:37      DigitalKiwi | iirc it matches any file named like "packagetoinsatll*tar.{gz.xz}
11:38      DigitalKiwi | so it matches all versions in the directory
11:38         Wraithan | unfortunately the routing gets all messed up when you have a default GW and not one pointing between the computers, what is the best way to fix this?
11:38      DigitalKiwi | but it installs the newest one
11:39      DigitalKiwi | thus, nothing bad happens, it is just a warning message that doesn't need to be there
11:39           stojic | Wraithan: just run dhcpd on one computers' nic, get ip from another and set up synergy using those ip adresses (that's how I was doing it)
11:40        cantabile | DigitalKiwi: Ok. Thanks for explaining this. I understand now. :)
11:40         Wraithan | stojic: you mean have one as a dhcp server?
11:40           stojic | Wraithan: yeah
11:40         Wraithan | ugh
11:41         Wraithan | should just work with static ips
11:41           stojic | Wraithan: it should
11:41           stojic | (I had dhcpd already configured and running at the time)

11:54            Caleb | lol
11:54            Caleb | naw this one gets 4000
11:54            Caleb | hahaha
11:54            Janno | O_o
11:55      DigitalKiwi | that's not what you said last night!
11:55            Caleb | lol

11:55            Caleb | i can even play urbanterror
11:55            Caleb | haha
11:55         johndarc | 4000 is still too low, is not it
11:55      AstralStorm | johndarc: glxgears is not a benchmark

11:57            Caleb | AstralStorm: well this card works where my nvidia 9400 didnt
11:57            Caleb | it would freeze up my system
11:57        cantabile | velcroshooz: works for me :)
11:57            Caleb | this card still makes the system act weird when i boot but it works and ive not had it freeze

11:58         johndarc | how come my glxgears doens't output the FPS count?
11:58      DigitalKiwi | the window is smaller than a pinky nail and hidden
11:58    demonicmaniac | johndarc: because you don't run it from terminal ?

11:58      velcroshooz | cantabile, not here, what we tried last night had no effect after looking into it more .. they popup fine if the layout is set to floating, but any tiling layout and it ignores the floating option and tiles the little window anyways :/ highly annoying
11:58            rooob | daedhel, :)
11:58         johndarc | demonicmaniac: I run it from terminal, but it doesn't do the math

12:16           busata | wisefool: most of the time using no xorg.conf file should be fine too
12:16            Caleb | or something isnt working right
12:16            Caleb | who knows
12:16         wisefool | (EE) intel(0): No kernel modesetting driver detected.
12:16         wisefool | that's in my Xorg.0.log
12:17         wisefool | looks like it's unloading the intel driver
12:17         wisefool | and using vesa presumably
12:17         wisefool | I got that error before, though, and it worked fine regardless
12:17         johndarc | Caleb: let us wait for AstralStorm's results

12:17        d_garbage | odd, i thought KMS was suppose to handle that gracefully?

12:20         wisefool | I'm pretty sure KMS was working before
12:20         wisefool | because the terminals were all in native res

12:22        m-i-l-a-n | speaking of KMS, only yesterday i was installing splashy and everything worked fine, but i still like to know how to see if my nvidia chipset supporst (or is supported by?) KMS
12:22        m-i-l-a-n | atm it looks like its using the ufbdev
12:23         johndarc | Caleb: 242
12:25         wisefool | hmm
12:26         wisefool | could putting laptop-mode in the daemons array have anything to do with it?
12:26      AstralStorm | johndarc: I have some 1920x1080 results with 16x aniso
12:27      AstralStorm | the card doesn't manage that at any good speed
12:27         johndarc | AstralStorm: is it higher than 300?
12:27      AstralStorm | it's close
12:27      AstralStorm | 287 or so
12:27      AstralStorm | cpufreq might've interfered, wait
12:27      AstralStorm | I'll set it to performance to be sure
12:27      AstralStorm | because I've noticed parts where it moved smoothly, then some where it lagged, displaying the same scene

12:29      AstralStorm | conservative sucks
12:29         johndarc | so you ran the benchmark at 551Mhz?
12:29      AstralStorm | possibly
12:29         johndarc | AstralStorm: are you running BFS or CFS?
12:29      AstralStorm | CFS
12:30         wisefool | okay uh removing cpufrequtils from my daemons fixed my problem

12:34          crouton | hey guys.. i've added "sshd : 192.168.2.13" to my guest arch installtion in win7.. i'd like to ssh to it locally from window but it seems to just sit there and timeout. any idea why this may be happening?
12:34          crouton | i added that line to hosts.allow
12:34         androide | did you edit your hosts.deny ?
12:34           wonder | androide, doesn't need that since he added his ip to .allow
12:35         androide | in my seedbox didnt
12:35          crouton | hosts.deny contains ALL: ALL i think
12:36           wonder | crouton, can you ping the server?
12:36          crouton | yea: ALL : ALL : DENY
12:36          crouton | yes i can
12:36           wonder | let me ask some questions first
12:36           wonder | guest arch, i believe you are using virtualbox or vmware?
12:36          crouton | vmware
12:37           wonder | ok
12:37          crouton | internet works fine too
12:37          crouton | inside the guest
12:37           wonder | what's the ip of the guest?
12:38         -!- chee is now known as snes
12:38          crouton | 192.168.245.129
12:38         -!- snes is now known as chee
12:38          crouton | i set the vm to use NAT
12:38         -!- chee is now known as snes
12:38         -!- snes is now known as chee
12:38         johndarc | can you ping from inside the vm?
12:39        LugarSivi | If I compile with makepkg as root, should I disable "fake root" in makepkg.conf or it doesn't matter to what is set?
12:39          crouton | to the host?
12:39          crouton | lemme try
12:39          crouton | yup
12:39           wonder | LugarSivi, never compile as root
12:39        LugarSivi | wonder: if I really trust a source... ?
12:39         johndarc | is internet connection working crouton ?
12:39           wonder | LugarSivi, same
12:39        LugarSivi | why not
12:40         johndarc | inside the vm?
12:40           wonder | LugarSivi, is not about trusting the source is more about messing the system
12:40          crouton | yes, it works.
12:40           wonder | LugarSivi, for example you can mess the permissions of the files inside the package
12:40           wonder | or even worse
12:40          crouton | i can also ssh to other servers from the guest
12:40           wonder | forgetting DESTDIR from make install
12:40           wonder | you'll end up with files on the sytem
12:40        LugarSivi | I see...
12:40          crouton | so the client seems okay.. something with the daemon
12:41          crouton | the daemon is running btw
12:41        LugarSivi | wonder: but if I don't use makepkg and compile traditional way (./configure) I must do it as root
12:41           wonder | LugarSivi, never do that too :)
12:42          crouton | okay how do i allow all connections into arch?
12:42          crouton | ALL : ALL ?
12:42         androide | editing your hosts.deny
12:42         androide | just comment that fucker
12:42           wonder | you'll end up with files on the system that are not managed by the package manager
12:42        LugarSivi | yes, I know all that. Pacman is the alpha and omega on arch
12:43        LugarSivi | in conjuction with aur
12:43          crouton | yea that works. i put "ALL : ALL" in hosts.allow and the connection works but why doesn't "ssh : 192.168.2.13" work ?
12:43          crouton | i mean sshd
12:43           wonder | LugarSivi, aur has build and you can compile packages that can be used by pacman
12:44           wonder | host.deny and put a # in front of theline
12:44        LugarSivi | wonder: I know, I'm reading wiki on that last hour or so
12:44        MrElendig | hosts.allow should overide hosts.deny tho
12:44          crouton | exactly
12:45           wonder | maybe 192.168.2.something is not the ip
12:45         johndarc | wonder: you have sshd running inside the vm, and you want to connect to it from the vm's host?
12:45           wonder | maybe is doing some freaking port forwarding
12:45        MrElendig | that would be my guess
12:45          crouton | yea seems like that
12:45          crouton | so how can i ... configure it properly then?
12:45          Frantic | guys, I have a raid5 array with 5 disks, and I've --added 3 more disks and --growed to all 8 disks. And now the array is reshaping on all disks. But it's doing it very very slowsly, wa doesn't go over 5% even tho I reniced the mdX_reshape to -15. Anything else I can do to make it speed up?
12:46          crouton | there was something about bridge connections i saw but not sure what they meant
12:46        MrElendig | Frantic: no
12:46           wonder | johndarc, why version me?
12:46   smooth_penguin | has anyone gotten the 1280x1024 using an external VGA monitor on the Acer D250 netbook?
12:46           tuntis | anybody got tips for http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=95868 ?
12:46            phrik | Title: Arch Linux Forums / Compiz, GNOME & catalyst-test: white window contents (at bbs.archlinux.org)
12:47         johndarc | I am not sure if your host will forward connections to the VM when using NAT
12:47        MrElendig | Frantic: btw, with a large array, you probably want raid6 instead
12:47      Wintervenom | If you've got multiple network interfaces, is it possible to combine these all into one to speed things like torrenting up?
12:47        MrElendig | Frantic: since in the time it takes to recover from a single disc failure, there is a good chance that you will get some data corruption
12:47        MrElendig | Wintervenom: depends on your isp
12:47          crouton | i see johndarc
12:48          crouton | okay whatever, this should be fine for now i guess
12:48           wonder | crouton, i always use bridge connection over nat
12:48      Wintervenom | MrElendig:  We get a bandwidth allotment per interface.
12:48        MrElendig | Wintervenom: your isp would have to give you several lines, and support bonding
12:48          crouton | thanks for the help people
12:48           wonder | the ip is from my network
12:48        MrElendig | wonder: which I doubt it will do unless you pay them alot
12:48        MrElendig | er..
12:48        MrElendig | Wintervenom: *

12:50         joeDeuce | i think is what you are wanting
12:51          Frantic | MrElendig: I'll think about the level but it's running reaaaaaly slowly :(
12:52          crouton | oh i got it. i did a 'who' inside the guest and saw the ip of the connected user. it was 192.168.245.1. added that to hosts.allow as "sshd : 192.168.245.1" and it works now.
12:52        MrElendig | Frantic: welcome to the world of raid5
12:53        MrElendig | Frantic: rebuilding large arrays can literally take days
12:53          Frantic | MrElendig: raid6 is just raid5 with an extra parity block, so it has the same striping, unsafe reads and the write-write penalty. Just that it provides a bit more data safety, or am I missing something? ):
12:53          Frantic | err, meant :)
12:53          Frantic | MrElendig: I agree it's going to take a while
12:54          Frantic | but it's not really using either the disk or the CPU
12:54        MrElendig | Frantic: but unlike raid5 it can survive data corruption while you are rebuilding after a single disc failure
12:54          Frantic | it's just slacking off for some reason :)
12:54          bioe007 | since people are talking about raid, anyone has opinion of 3ware's 95xx series of controllers w/linux?
12:54        MrElendig | Frantic: ofcourse raid 10 or similar is better in that regard, but the downside is the way worse storage efficiency
12:55      AstralStorm | johndarc: score is 189 actually
12:55      AstralStorm | the shadows are killing this card
12:55          Frantic | MrElendig: well in my case raid5 works because the machine is in a datacenter and in case of a single disk failiure it will be replaced with a new disk almost instantly :)
12:55          Frantic | so unless 2 disks happen to crash within 1 hour, it's safe :)
12:55      AstralStorm | (or this cpu)
12:55         shf10105 | hey guys, i have just upgraded from ruby18 to ruby19 for testing but it cant find libssl.so.1.0.0 and other libs - any idea?
12:55          crouton | alright gtg. thanks again for the help. later
12:55        MrElendig | Frantic: the problem isn't replacing it, the problem is the 20h it takes to rebuild it
12:55         johndarc | AstralStorm: I dunno why would you get such a low score
12:55      AstralStorm | shadows.
12:55          Frantic | MrElendig: you're actually right :)
12:55        MrElendig | Frantic: if you get corruptuion while it rebuilds, you lose data
12:55      AstralStorm | and 16x anisotropy ;p
12:56      AstralStorm | johndarc: did you run it at 1920x1080 16x aniso too?
12:56        asdfffdsa | So I've got a UMPC with 512mB of RAM, but with very little persistent storage space.  My question is: can I forgo making a swap partition?  Or should I at least have SOME swap?
12:56      AstralStorm | anisotropy cuts framerate 3x
12:56      AstralStorm | but the real deal is the thadows
12:56      AstralStorm | *shadows
12:56         -!- Zearan_ is now known as Zearan
12:57        MrElendig | asdfffdsa: use a swap file instead
12:57          bioe007 | asdfffdsa: you could consider making a swap file
12:57         johndarc | AstralStorm: default configs, with aniso x16, windowed
12:57      AstralStorm | ahh, fullscreen here
12:57        MrElendig | asdfffdsa: unless it's a ssd or similar, in that case, never use swap
12:57        asdfffdsa | MrElendig, bioe007: Thanks, I'll look into it
12:57      AstralStorm | johndarc: and default at 1920x1080 or lower?
12:57         johndarc | windowed, probably 800x600?
12:57        asdfffdsa | MrElendig: Yes, it's a SSD
12:57        MrElendig | swaping on a ssd kills it life
12:58      AstralStorm | oh wait
12:58      AstralStorm | windowed is 1024x768
12:58   smooth_penguin | anyone ever gotten the 1280x1024 using an external VGA monitor on the Acer D250 netbook?
12:58      AstralStorm | I'll run that
12:58         johndarc | yes, 1024x768
12:58         johndarc | still is a low score for your card

13:09        MrElendig | shf10105: never ever -Sy stuff, always -Syu && -S stuff
13:09        MrElendig | shf10105: give us the exact error

13:09        MrElendig | "something broken" doesn't help us help you
13:09         shf10105 | i tried to resolve that yesterday here, which took me 2hours
13:10         shf10105 | with no success
13:10        MrElendig | krankkatze: stop alsamixer, chromium and whatever extra mixer app you are running
13:10      AstralStorm | johndarc: getting 226 in 1024x768
13:10      AstralStorm | something definitely is wrong
13:10      AstralStorm | probably catalyst 10.4 ;p
13:11      AstralStorm | oh wait
13:11        MrElendig | shf10105: how is your qt broken
13:11         shf10105 | it like i dont have it installed but pacman says i had
13:11         shf10105 | so it always fails on -Syu
13:11      AstralStorm | ok, so how do I make catalyst 10.3 work on Xorg 1.7.6?
13:12         shf10105 | i will make a clean reinstall
13:12        MrElendig | shf10105: pastebin the error
13:12        MrElendig | shf10105: don't reinstall
13:12        MrElendig | shf10105: also check df -h
13:12        MrElendig | AstralStorm: you don't
13:12      AstralStorm | meh
13:12      AstralStorm | ;p
13:12         shf10105 | MrElendig: ok, thanks - my disk is ok, i have that error for about 6months already
13:12        MrElendig | AstralStorm: unless you happen to work for the driver department of amd
13:13         shf10105 | so im a little outdated
13:13         shf10105 | ill pastebin it
13:13      AstralStorm | they need a rebuild for the DPMS stuff
13:13        MrElendig | AstralStorm: in which case the manager will tell you "do it, and you can find somewhere else to work"
13:14      AstralStorm | I wonder why
13:14      AstralStorm | it's not like they're pushing 10.4 on us ;p
13:14      AstralStorm | (which has numerous bugs)
13:14        MrElendig | amd only support the latest driver
13:15      AstralStorm | 10.4 is a BETA.
13:15      AstralStorm | 10.3 is the latest driver.

13:18     velcroshooz | how do you get around the 'unknown desktop enviroment' error when trying to set default browser with xdg-settings using a wm? trying to set chromium as default in awesome/openbox ..
13:18        shf10105 | cantabile: btw.  just dont need kde, because i have no kde app installed
13:22       cantabile | velcroshooz: `export DE=gnome` in .xinitrc is what I use, but I also have gnome installed.
13:23           verma | I have ATI catalyst drivers installed.  I just rebooted my computer, and seems like the driver is not working correctly, when I do glxinfo, I get a X Error of failed request: BadRequest, is there something I need to do to get the ATI drivers working between reboots?
13:24        shf10105 | MrElendig: do you already have an idea, what i could try?

13:24           xenol | anyone experienced black screen on intel kms with .33 kernel?
13:25     velcroshooz | cantabile, yeah i dont wanna do that, came up with that on the web using xfce instead, but it ends up needing dependencies of whatever de is set for xdg-settings to work right then .. there is a way around it, i have one machine i setup months ago doing it correctly, i just cant remember how :/
13:25       MrElendig | shf10105: pacman -S phonon qt
13:25       MrElendig | then -Syu
13:25       MrElendig | there is about 300 threads about that on the bbs
13:26           verma | seems like fglrx_drv is segfaulting on me :(

13:27     velcroshooz | cantabile, yeah, messed with xdg-open and got it half working, but its just not quite working all the time

13:28       MrElendig | velcroshooz: make sure you have perl-file-mimeinfo installed
13:29         augustl | is MBR style partitioning old and silly, or is it still a good alternative? Asking since my current GPT doesn't support installing Windows on it (windows can't boot from GPT partitions).
13:29          tzervo | velcroshooz: there is also a very good python script by xyne called mimeo that does what xdg-open is supposed to do. have you tried that?
13:30       MrElendig | augustl: use mbr unless you have a >2TB disc
13:30       MrElendig | >=2TB*
13:30        shf10105 | MrElendig: oh great, it finally seems to work (so simple) - 2gb download -> 4gb install - think that will take some time

13:30       MrElendig | augustl: or if you are on a macbook

13:32            tigr | cool
13:32     velcroshooz | MrElendig, perl-file-mimeinfo is installed .. i messed with xdg-open and modified it so it pointed to chromium instead of chromium-browser, so running it from cli errors out on the browser i dont have then finally opens it in chromium .. but its not set with xdg-settings still, and links still wont work (except in cli, because i have it in .bashrc)

13:36      ryanaghdam | hi. i have apache running with mod_security enabled and would like to have email alerts when something is detected.  i haven't had much luck finding a config. option for that, so i was thinking something that could tail a file and on change, send an email.  does anyone know of something that would do this?
13:36        shf10105 | MrElendig: well i was referring to other breaks - like a year ago, i couldnt log in anymore because i couldnt get hal to work (when upgrading to new x), so i used an xconf finally - then my awesome wm broke - i was forced to upgrade which again had a new config and so on, took me ~3days to resolve everything
13:36      ryanaghdam | augustl: Mine is 4GB, I'm almost positive I'm using around 1 GB
13:37           anrxc | ryanaghdam: OSSEC HIDS?
13:37          barzam | in awesome wm, how can I change the color of the various boxes (promtbox textbox etc)?
13:37           anrxc | by changing colors in your theme
13:37      shoeunited | barzam: you need to edit the lua config
13:38        shf10105 | barzam: there is a theme somewhere
13:38       MrElendig | shf10105: No idea how you broke your hal, I didn't have any probmems. When it comes to awesome, it's a know fact that the awesome devs breaks the config on updates, nothing to do with arch.
13:38     velcroshooz | tzervo,  i will look into that thanks, i always struggle with this on new installs without a de
13:38           anrxc | or on per-widget basis by applying pango markup
13:38      ryanaghdam | anrxc: I haven't heard of that, it looks pretty cool. thanks
13:38          barzam | shoeunited: the theme.lua or the rc.lua?
13:38        shf10105 | MrElendig: well it never worked, not even live-cds working here
13:38      shoeunited | theme it would stand to reason.
13:38       MrElendig | shf10105: the thing is that you can not run arch partially upgraded. That will cause problems, it have been proven over and over again.
13:38        shf10105 | MrElending: on every other system i never had a problem
13:39       MrElendig | s/have/has/
13:39      shoeunited | barzam: check the wikis on his site, they're pretty extensive :)
13:39           anrxc | ryanaghdam: excellent host based ids, has support for a lot of things, including mod security
13:39       MrElendig | most recent examples are: libreadline, libpng, libjpg and libssl/libcrypto
13:40          tzervo | velcroshooz: you can also add mimeman to your tools for configuring mime handling, it edits .local/share/applications/whatever files through the command line
13:40          tzervo | velcroshooz: they cooperate well with each other
13:40          barzam | sorry to bother you, found plenty of into in the wiki ofc :)
13:40       MrElendig | all of which were only a problem when people either partially upgraded their system, or used  out of date/broken mirror
13:41      shoeunited | barzam: No bother, :)  Just trying to help :)
13:42        shf10105 | MrElendig: ok, i didnt upgrade the system for half a year as i said, because i needed the system running and couldnt afford it to get broken again - everything works until you try to upgrade single packages, either whole system or nothing - i know that now
13:43       MrElendig | shf10105: sounds like you want debian or slack instead
13:43       MrElendig | :)
13:43       MrElendig | (or just update more often)
13:43       MrElendig | updating often usually leads to less problems in the long run
13:43      JohnWittle | shf10105: similarly, if you are upgrading single packages out of [testing], make SURE to comment it out before pacman -Syu'ing, because testing is meant for individual package updates and every EVERY EVERYTHING will break if you -Syu testing.
13:44        shf10105 | MrElendig: never liked them, i really love gentoo, but i never used it for desktops
13:44        shf10105 | MrElendig: so i ended up @arch
13:45     velcroshooz | JohnWittle, you couldnt be more wrong
13:45      Armadillux | hey archers! got a problem i cant really trace.... :(
13:45     velcroshooz | JohnWittle, cherry picking out of testing is highly unsafe and not supported, when you open testing you Syu just like you would with any other repo.
13:45             rio | hm, do you know where to tell gnome that i want to use xim as default input method? i want to use .XCompose
13:46          Zearan | Armadillux: go ahead
13:46       MrElendig | velcroshooz: depends on what you grab from it
13:46       MrElendig | you should't use [testing] unless you know what you are doing tho
13:47      JohnWittle | velcroshooz: I've only ever used testing to cherry pick very, very specific packages to upgrade them to whatever unstable versions they have. On both occasions I've -Syu'd with testing enabled, every single library reference on my entire machine broke
13:47       MrElendig | and if you do enable [testing] and -Syu, the you really should enable [community-testing] too
13:47      Armadillux | ok.. it seems that arch tries to rerun the boot process after booting up
13:47      Armadillux | means.. after loaden/ bk the deamons
13:47       MrElendig | else you will probably have some problems with stuff from [community] not working
13:47      Armadillux | the resolution changes
13:47       MrElendig | Armadillux: what gfx card?
13:48     velcroshooz | MrElendig, im sure there are packages you can pick and it not screw up but in general its bad practice
13:48      Armadillux | 4890
13:48      Armadillux | ati
13:48       MrElendig | Armadillux: disable kms
13:48       MrElendig | it's not really usable with the -ati driver atm
13:48         augustl | long after a large-ish cp -R to a usb thumb stick finished, the activity light still flickers intensively and iotop has a "flush-8:16" on 99%. What's going on?
13:48        shf10105 | MrElendig: the only packages that i never wanted to upgrade was my awesome wm or any other package that arent backward compatible, like wine - but the dependencies killed that idea
13:48      Armadillux | ok i'll give it a try! thx
13:49       MrElendig | shf10105: --ignorepkg and abs exist
13:49        JavaAtom | augustl: Still takes a while to write all that data to a device,
13:49         augustl | JavaAtom: so even though the cp -R command "finished", it still writes?
13:49        JavaAtom | augustl: if you unmount it, you'll still have the flickering light, but not for long.
13:49        JavaAtom | augustl: Yup. Buffers are fun.
13:49         augustl | so if I unmount it, I'll get corrupted data as well?
13:50        JavaAtom | augustl: Nope. You've sent data and -then- sent the unmount command in the queue.
13:50       MrElendig | augustl: umount will try to flush it
13:50         augustl | I see
13:50         augustl | linux =D
13:50        JavaAtom | augustl: Once the buffer is flushed (the light stops) then it's done and done.
13:50       MrElendig | and complain if it can't
13:50        shf10105 | MrElendig: whatever i tried, as I upgraded my X, my wm was broken, recompiling and so on, no success - even my 2d performance decreased, had to disable soft scroll in firefox and other things
13:50        JavaAtom | augustl: Not just linux. Windows and MacOS do it too.
13:50       MrElendig | shf10105: what gfx card?
13:50        JavaAtom | augustl: That's why you have to "eject" devices.
13:51     velcroshooz | JohnWittle, possibly because you didnt have community testing enabled as well, i couldnt say. there is nothing in testing right now that is broken at all really, nothing at all to break an entire machine. its your machine, but you need to be careful doing that with criitcal packages, because it can and has many times broken peoples setups.
13:51        shf10105 | MrElendig: Nvidia 5900xt pretty old
13:51         augustl | JavaAtom: I see, makes sense
13:51         augustl | so the cp command will tell the filesystem what to do, and then the filesystem does the buffering and what not?
13:52         augustl | since the cp command seems unaware of buffering going on
13:52 OpenBluntSurgry | How can i see if linux recognizes a new drive i installed? its a 1TB hitachi
13:52        shf10105 | MrElendig: before that i could play games ~60fps -> after that frame rates were ~15fps ; and many other bugs
13:52         augustl | OpenBluntSurgry: connect it and do "dmesg | tail"
13:52 OpenBluntSurgry | augustl its not usb its internal
13:52 OpenBluntSurgry | augustl so its connected
13:53         augustl | OpenBluntSurgry: my poor man trick is do "ls /dev | grep sd" =P
13:53       MrElendig | shf10105: should work just fine with the nvidia-173xx driver
13:53       MrElendig | there was a little while (about 2 weeks) some time ago where that driver wasn't updated for the new xorg
13:53       MrElendig | but that was just temporary
13:53       MrElendig | shf10105: sounds like you got a mismatch between the kernel module version, and the userspace version, which caused it to fall back to vesa
13:54       MrElendig | or something like that
13:54        shf10105 | MrElendig: acceleration is there, it is loaded and so on - it is just slower
13:54        shf10105 | MrElendig: according to Xorg.log
13:54       MrElendig | augustl: ls /dev/sd*
13:54       MrElendig | augustl: useless | is useless
13:54        shf10105 | MrElendig: i can live with that, because soon i get a new system here
13:54         augustl | MrElendig: ah
13:56         augustl | OpenBluntSurgry: that won't find any /dev/hd* type disks though. I'm sure there's a command you can run, but I don't know which one.
13:56        shf10105 | MrElendig: the only thing that bothered my was that my small eee900 with gma900 intel 900mhz had better performance on flash videos and scrolled firefox fluently
13:57         ksemeks | Hi. I have a bit of a situation. So, my code keeps throwing an exception, 'Audio device unavailable', and that's when no audio/video were playing. The problem isn't related to permissions, since i still get the same error when i run the code as root. So, from the ##java channel they told me to ask for questions here, so can anyone explain this to me?
13:57       MrElendig | shf10105: really sounds like a broken driver
13:57         augustl | OpenBluntSurgry: I think "fdisk -l" (as root) lists them
13:58       MrElendig | OpenBluntSurgry: dmesg will tell you if it sees the disc at all
13:58         *     MrElendig would never buy a hitachi disc
13:58        shf10105 | MrElendig: i will see on next reboot, if it was outdated, it will reinstall it - still fetching packages
13:59       MrElendig | OpenBluntSurgry: tho usually it would show up in fdisk -l too
14:01            ars1 | anyone can recommend me secure ftp server software ?
14:01            ars1 | with webui and some net traffic meters ?
14:02       MrElendig | ars1: use sftp instead
14:02       MrElendig | ars1: if you really must use ftp, use vsftp
14:02       MrElendig | vsftpd*
14:02            ars1 | thanks
14:03       MrElendig | but ftp is bad(tm)
14:03          gardar | nonono, ftp is good
14:03       MrElendig | so you really shouldn't run a ftp server
14:03       MrElendig | unless you absolutly needs to, and you actually know wtf you are doing
14:03         augustl | how do I remove a GPT and repartition as MBR? Complete data loss is acceptable.
14:03       MrElendig | enjoy your hacked box if you don
14:03       MrElendig | 't
14:04       MrElendig | augustl: fdisk
14:04          gardar | it's like that with everything... Be wise and use ssl
14:04         augustl | tnx
14:04       MrElendig | instead of ftp + ssl, use sftp
14:04         augustl | this is probably very old; how big should the swap partition be? ;)
14:05          gardar | sftp is slower
14:05            ars1 | MrElendig: hmm and maybe if i add only trusted allowed users / ip ?
14:05       MrElendig | not by much
14:05          gardar | augustl: rule of thumb was twice as big as your ram... but no bigger than 1.5gb
14:05       MrElendig | ars1: you should to that no matter what you use
14:05         augustl | so 4gb ram = 1.5 gb swap+
14:05         augustl | ?
14:05          Zearan | augustl: the size of your ram so you have the insurance you always can hibernate xD
14:05           majki | sftp using blowfish encryption can be quite fast
14:06          gardar | yeah I'd do 1.5gb
14:06         augustl | I never hibernate
14:06          Zearan | augustl: then ignore me :)
14:06       MrElendig | augustl: use a swapfile or no swap at all
14:07       MrElendig | unless you have special needs, which I doubt you have
14:07       MrElendig | augustl: btw, brtfs is nice
14:07         augustl | MrElendig: what's a swapfile?
14:07       MrElendig | augustl: a file acting as swap, instead of a partion
14:07      shoeunited | swap|file
14:07         augustl | so if I just don't have a swap partition it'll be a file instead?
14:07         trifler | Is there a cli-calculator than handles () calcs?
14:08       MrElendig | augustl: only if you explicitly make a swap file
14:08            grte | qalc?
14:08         trifler | that*
14:08          gardar | or good ol calc
14:08         augustl | MrElendig: where will stuff be paged if I don't have a swapfile or swap partition?
14:08        solsTiCe | you can hibernate with a swap file ?
14:08            grte | qalc is a better app, I've heard.
14:08       MrElendig | make a file of /n/ mb using dd, mkswap it, mount -o loop it
14:08         augustl | MrElendig: nice! Is there a wiki page for that?
14:09      shoeunited | !wiki swapfile
14:09           phrik | shoeunited: Swap - ArchWiki: <http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Swap>
14:09      shoeunited | B)
14:09       MrElendig | er.. not mount it
14:09       MrElendig | just swapon it
14:09        solsTiCe | I wonder if mounting it as loop is needed for a swapfile
14:09       MrElendig | and trow in in fstab
14:09          Arkham | strapon /dev/sda4
14:09         augustl | very cool
14:10         augustl | what are the implications of not having a swap?
14:10          Arkham | init killing things when finishing memory
14:10         augustl | iPhone mode, yay :)
14:11              nn | iPhone mode?
14:11          Zearan | augustl: you cant hibernate, you should have enough ram and some people say that the write-operations of hdd would be slower... dunno why and never found a proof for that
14:11         *            nn twitches
14:11         *      oitnelis pats nn, i know, i know

14:12         augustl | the app store is cencored. Big deal =P
14:12      shoeunited | In soviet macintosh, BSD frees you!
14:12          Arkham | oitnelis: apple owns you all
14:13         augustl | when they start censoring the browser I'll react too, but censoring the app store isn't that big of a deal imo
14:13        oitnelis | Meh, any form of censorship is a big deal.

14:15          augustl | AbortRetryFail: at least you can install anything you download from the web on it though
14:15   AbortRetryFail | google, phone manufacturers, and service providers all can censor the market
14:15   AbortRetryFail | augustl: exactly why it's not a big deal

14:51            oxez | I'm trying to get suspend to work correctly. The problem is that my laptop cannot resume. The screen will either stay blank or "corrupted". I tried adding "resume" and also removing "autodetect" hooks, didn't help. What message logs could I parse? (tried updating xorg to 1.8, with the beta nvidia drivers, still doesn't work). pm-suspend.log: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/206150/

14:54       MrElendig | lots of info on google about the problem
14:56            oxez | MrElendig: I tried most of the tricks I found on google already. I'm kinda in desperation mode hehe. There must be one that will work on my laptop (it seems to be an unpopular model, tho, makes thing a bit harder)
14:57            oxez | I'm not even sure nvidia drivers are causing the problem
14:57       MrElendig | nvidia is known to be a bit troublesome with suspend
14:57       MrElendig | you could always try the vesa driver instead, just to test
14:58            oxez | I tried with the "nv" driver, on a xmonad setup, and I was still getting a blank screen
14:58       MrElendig | tho that would require you to uninstall the nvidia driver and install libgl instead
14:58       MrElendig | nv doesn't support many nvidia cards, and nvidia have finally oficially killed the nv project
14:59            oxez | Yea. I do my tests with my two laptops. My Sager one works perfectly (geforce 8700m), but this toshiba's geforce 230m seems to refuse to cooperate
15:00       MrElendig | same wm and so on?
15:00          gavino | iceWM
15:00       MrElendig | same driver version?
15:01            oxez | MrElendig: Yes. But I do have an issue with versions > 190.53 on this laptop. X flashes a few times before actually starting. Maybe it has something to do with resume not working
15:02            oxez | MrElendig: I'm gonna try what you suggested and install the vesa driver alongwith libgl. I really need to figure out what's causing the problem... there's no log files that I found that could give hints =/
15:03       MrElendig | oxez: one thing you could try, was to ssh in, kill X, unload the nvidia module, load it again and then start X again
15:03       MrElendig | and see if anything happens
15:04            oxez | MrElendig: right, gonna try that
15:08            rxvt | why even as sudo when i go to "sudo sync; echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches" i get Permission denied?!??!

15:15            oxez | MrElendig: yea can't ssh in, network doesn't work on resume. Gonna go with the vesa/Libgl way to see
15:16       MrElendig | fcuk112: do your hardware support kvm?

15:17         fcuk112 | MrElendig: the latest version from their website.
15:17       MrElendig | fcuk112: don't say "latest"

15:18         fcuk112 | VMware-Workstation-Full-7.0.1-227600.x86_64
15:18       MrElendig | fcuk112: also, the wiki says that you need to set it to /etc/rc.d/vmware.d/, not /etc/rc.d/
15:19       MrElendig | fcuk112: and you might have to create a few folders inside that path if you are unlucky
15:19         fcuk112 | MrElendig: yea i set it to /etc/rc.d/vmware.d/
15:19         fcuk112 | i tried creating that folder, then it complained /etc/rc.d/vmware.d/ is not an init directory
15:19       MrElendig | someone removed that part from the wiki tho >_>
15:21       MrElendig | does /etc/rc.d/vmware.d/ exist?
15:22       MrElendig | if not; try mkdir -p /etc/rc.d/vmware.d/{rc{0..6},init}.d
15:22       MrElendig | in teory vmware should create those on it's own, but sometimes it seems to stupid to do so
15:23            oxez | MrElendig: Using the vesa driver (installing libgl instead of nvidia-utils as well) produces the same issue =/
15:23       MrElendig | hmm
15:23         fcuk112 | MrElendig: thank you, that seemed to get me going.

15:46             Mion | only thing that could make it fail afaik is if the /etc wasn't correctly mounted during install, or that the shadow package wasn't installed or similar
15:46             Mion | but that would usually lead to other more noticable problems first

15:49           wonder | fill a bug report
15:49          daedhel | quitr: it mean you probably installed alltray from the aur
15:49           wonder | the maintainer or who did update it should use force option

15:54           quitr | wonder: my real bug reports are more verbose
15:54           quitr | don't worry
15:54           quitr | i write too much in fact
15:54    neuro_damage | awww...well no there's no source available for the program unfortunately
15:55            Mion | there can never be too much info in a bug report
15:55    neuro_damage | juniper VPN support for linux sucks only old versions of Redhat and 32 bit
15:55           quitr | there can be too much of the wrong kind of info
15:55            Mion | neuro_damage: then you are stuck with making a bin32 package, or using a chroot

15:56           quitr | "here use this patch... there's no trojan in it i swear..."
15:57           quitr | i wonder if packagers would notice... i think if the patch fixed a legit bug, but also installed a trojan many woudn't notice
15:57           quitr | they can't all know how to code
15:58          wonder | i don't trust patches from unknown people
15:58          wonder | heck i don't even trust debian patches anymore
15:58          wonder | =)
15:59           quitr | wonder: so you look them over completely?
15:59           quitr | or what
15:59          wonder | no, i'm waiting upstream to check them and use only patches that are on their bugtracker/commited in svn/git/whatever
16:00           quitr | ic
16:00           quitr | that's the slow way
16:00           quitr | what if upstream is slow?
16:00            t0rc | i see too!
16:00          wonder | then i trust patches that i can understand
16:00          wonder | :)
16:00           quitr | for example, i submitted a bug report to the dante project, they sent me a patch, but it still isn't in upstream
16:01           Janno | Only crazy people would trust debian dev's after !debian

16:04    neuro_damage | what do I need with arch linux to run 32bit binaries?
16:04    neuro_damage | I forget the name of the package
16:04          wonder | install some lib32 or do a chroot
16:05        poseidon | I'm running sshd on my comp, and I'm trying to ssh into it (from same comp).  I followed the guide on the arch wiki, but I keep getting a "connection timed out"
16:05         daedhel | you cant have both world.... you cant have a near-upstream distro that just works (withou configs)
16:05        poseidon | any idea as to what the problem could be?
16:05         daedhel | you ssh into yourslef?
16:05           Janno | poseidon: did you allow sshd in host.allow?
16:06         daedhel | its like dividing by 0
16:06         daedhel | you gonna make a black hole in your box
16:07          wonder | poseidon, maybe you are blocking it using some crappy firewall?
16:10        helgikrs | wonder: if the firewall is successfully blocking it, then why is it crappy? :P
16:11          wonder | because is blocking stuff that he wants to be opened:D
16:11        poseidon | wonder: No, I'm running default arch.  (I'm running ssh and sshd from that comp)
16:11           quitr | wonder: how does this "force" option work in packaging?
16:11        helgikrs | poseidon: have you added sshd : all : allow in hosts.allow?
16:11        helgikrs | (or a specific host if you'd like)
16:11         poseidon | helgikrs: I have "sshd: ALL" in my hosts.allow, is that correct?
16:12         helgikrs | poseidon: should work, yes
16:12           wonder | quitr, the package that has a force option, will be marked as a valid update even the pkgver is lower than the one you got in your system
16:12         helgikrs | poseidon: ssh localhost
16:12           wonder | man PKGBUILD
16:12         helgikrs | poseidon: does that work?
16:13         poseidon | helgikrs: yes
16:13            quitr | thx
16:13         helgikrs | poseidon: so it's not working from another computer?
16:13        coolkehon | how do I found out which device is my dvd burner, I have a cdburner and dvd burner in my computer
16:13         helgikrs | poseidon: is either computer behind a firewall or a router?
16:14           wonder | poseidon, so doing ssh localhost doesn't work?
16:14         helgikrs | wonder: he said yes, so i assume it works :P
16:14        coolkehon | check /etc/hosts.deny poseidon
16:15         helgikrs | coolkehon: hosts.allow takes precedance over deny
16:15         helgikrs | coolkehon: shouldn't matter, and default is to block all, so ...
16:15        coolkehon | I haven't seen what you guys were talking about
16:15         helgikrs | ^^
16:15        coolkehon | i just know about the block all being default
16:15          augustl | my /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc doesn't seem to execute when I start x. How can I fix this?
16:15        coolkehon | how do I found out which device is my dvd burner, I have a cdburner and dvd burner in my computer
16:16         poseidon | helgikrs: does the default arch install [base] with oppenssl bring in any firewalls
16:16         poseidon | because the sshd and ssh are both on my laptop with arch.
16:17         helgikrs | poseidon: "ssh localhost" works?, so a) are you trying to connect from another computer? if not, then what command is not working?
16:18         helgikrs | poseidon: or are you trying the local ip the computer has?
16:19         poseidon | helgikrs: I'm on my laptop.  I have sshd running.  From the same laptop I run "ssh -p 22 user@ipaddress"
16:19        coolkehon | I get this error with growisofs
16:19        coolkehon | xecuting 'builtin_dd if=/root/bt4-final.iso of=/dev/sr1 obs=32k seek=0'
16:19        coolkehon | :-( write failed: Invalid argument
16:19        coolkehon | any ideas why?
16:20         helgikrs | poseidon: is it the correct ipaddress? :P Or maybe behind a router that blocks port 22?
16:20         helgikrs | poseidon: you said ssh localhost works, so it's not a problem with ssh
16:31         poseidon | helgikrs: It's the correct ip.  Is there a way I can find out if my router blocks port 22?
16:34         JavaAtom | poseidon: I'd say run an nmap against your external IP.
16:34         JavaAtom | poseidon: Something like `nmap -sS -v <external IP>
16:35          korin43 | is there a pacman command that will reinstall everything?
16:36             tigr | korin43, why do you want to do that?
16:36          korin43 | I rebuilt some packages using pacbuilder, and I think I broke something, but I don't remember all of the packages it built
16:36         helgikrs | korin43: pacman -S $(pacman -Qq)
16:36         JavaAtom | poseidon: Also might want to make sure your hosts.allow file has a line in there for ssh.
16:36          daevski | Anyone know if I can connect from winXP to samba share on arch, via the hostname or similar? IP changes are making my network drives fail to connect sometimes.
16:37         poseidon | JavaAtom: it does
16:37         JavaAtom | daevski: I've never found a pleasant way of connecting via hostname. IP is the only sure way I can think of.
16:37          korin43 | thanks a lot
16:37         JavaAtom | daevski: Any way you could put in a DHCP reservation?
16:37          daevski | JavaAtom, oh... well at least someone knows :-p[
16:37             tigr | korin43, look in the pacman.log to see which packages were recently upgraded
16:37         JavaAtom | daevski: The problem being that connecting via hostname requires a user/pass challenge, which almost never works right.
16:38          daevski | JavaAtom, I can make this pc static IP, but I was thinking about after moving around to diff networks, etc, also.
16:38          daevski | I don't move often though, so static IP should be okay.
16:38         JavaAtom | daevski: IPv6 and you're golden... :-p
16:38         JavaAtom | daevski: 1 ip address forever
16:38     neuro_damage | that's unfortunate, thanks though :)
16:38          daevski | JavaAtom, I don't play with ipv6 much yet... I used to at work, but not enough to understand it.
16:38          daevski | JavaAtom, oh okay. That sounds kinda ideal
16:39         poseidon | helgikrs: I ran nmap and got "22/tcp    open  ssh
16:39         helgikrs | poseidon: hmm
16:39         helgikrs | poseidon: but still can't connect?
16:39         poseidon | no
16:39     neuro_damage | the reason I ask is that my archlinux x86_64 at home is able to run the binary but just mentions it's running in 32 bit mode
16:39     neuro_damage | whoopsies
16:39     neuro_damage | that's my gentoo box at home :), nvm
16:39          korin43 | tigr: Thanks, that did it :)
16:40             tigr | korin43, great!
16:41          msierks | I have been having an issue with arch for the past few months where when the system needs to read from the hard drive it will become unresponsive for seconds at a time, is there some way i can track down exactly what is causing this issue and solve it ?
16:41         andrew12 | msierks: sounds like a hard drive failing
16:41         helgikrs | mirmillo: are you getting any errors in dmesg?
16:41         JavaAtom | daevski: one of the big selling points behind IPv6 is that, instead of NAT and all this stuff, literally every computer/network device on the planet could have a unique IP and we'd still have a bunch left over.
16:41         helgikrs | msierks: ^
16:42         *       JavaAtom admits his gross oversimplification of IPv6 and apologizes profusely for his blasphemies.
16:42         Losowski | yo
16:42          daevski | JavaAtom, well that's good.
16:42          msierks | andrew12, the drives are practically brand new, and are set up on a raid 1 array
16:42              scj | I heard the figure of 1500 unique ipv6 addresses for every square meter of land on the planet
16:42          msierks | andrew12, I would doubt they are failing
16:42         JavaAtom | scj: Something like that. :-D
16:43         andrew12 | msierks: then I don't know :\
16:43         helgikrs | msierks: any errors in dmesg?
16:43          msierks | yes, I can pastbin them
16:44         helgikrs | ok
16:44         JavaAtom | scj: Then again, at the rate with which the number of our communicative devices increase in density, I'm not sure that will be enough.
16:44         andrew12 | so anyways, a question. how large should I make a /boot partition?
16:44            uouou | I bet there'll be a rise in networked appliances
16:44         JavaAtom | andrew12: 50-100MB
16:44            uouou | lights and heat
16:44         helgikrs | andrew12: 100mb should be sufficient
16:44         andrew12 | okay, thanks. I'm trying to install arch on my MacBook :)
16:44         helgikrs | you can make it as small as 20mb
16:45         helgikrs | even smaller
16:45         helgikrs | :P
16:45         andrew12 | I was able to install Ubuntu on it long ago, going to try to put arch on it.
16:45              scj | JavaAtom: by the time we've filled the ipv6 address space, we've already colonized more planets
16:45         andrew12 | only thing that I don't like is that cfdisk doesn't like GUID so I have to use a GParted live CD to set up the paritions
16:45              scj | thus more space \o/
16:46         JavaAtom | scj: mmm.... maybe. I doubt our progress as a species, since, you know, there's "money to be made" promoting stagnation and stasis.
16:46         andrew12 | What happened to IPv1-3,5?
16:46         JavaAtom | andrew12: Died in captivity.
16:46         andrew12 | Aww.
16:46         JavaAtom | andrew12: Never made it out into the wild due to their horrible mating practices.
16:46         andrew12 | rofl.
16:47         JavaAtom | At least with IP4, there was "the handshake"
16:47         JavaAtom | And with IP6, it's a variation of the handshake.
16:47         JavaAtom | the, ah, odd-numbered IPs... well... what they did was too graphic to post here.
16:48            rooob | To use IPv6 you have to know the ultra-secret "in-the-cool-kids-club" handshake, then?
16:48               nn | No
16:48          msierks | helgikrs, http://pastebin.com/zSJsDRZs, thats everything, and I was wrong it is a warning

16:49         helgikrs | ata3.01: SATA link down (SStatus 0 SControl 300)
16:49            rooob | scj, the advent of self-replicating nanobots might necessitate more addresses/meter
16:50         helgikrs | msierks: seems like that could be the cause of it?
16:50         JavaAtom | rooob: Actually, all you need to talk to IP6 is some IPSec and some slutty clothes. Lipstick works too.
16:50         daevski_ | JavaAtom, haha
16:51        arlamczyk | when i try to scan for ap, nothing happens
16:51               nn | You just need a decent router and a willing peer
16:51          msierks | helgikrs, is there anything I can do to fix it ?
16:52         JavaAtom | arlamczyk: I don't think they like you then.
16:52        arlamczyk | sure seems like it
16:52         daevski_ | JavaAtom, I'm curious and don't feel like reading, atm, so what would index the ipv6 addresses so that all the pc's in the world would have different addresses? Or would it just be the same as it is now; first come first serve?
16:52         poseidon | When trying to ssh, I get the debug information "debug2: ssh_connect: needpriv 0"  wHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
16:52         poseidon | sorry, caps lock
16:53         daevski_ | JavaAtom, I forgot how the internet works for a second.... nvm that question
16:53        arlamczyk | i bypassed wireless setup during arch install using a wired connection instead and it worked fine
16:53         daevski_ | JavaAtom, I get my ip (external) from ISP, and internal would be indexed on router lol
16:54         JavaAtom | daevski_: The brilliant part is that there is no NAT for IPv6. You just get a block of IPs.
16:54         daevski_ | nice
16:54         helgikrs | msierks: i really have no idea, but i think it's reasonable to guess this might be the cause of it, so that narrows it atleast
16:54         JavaAtom | daevski_: It's like how businesses get a set of X amount of public IPs.
16:54         JavaAtom | only in this case you get them for your internal devices.
16:55          msierks | helgikrs, okay thank you, I will continue this investigation
16:55         JavaAtom | So, you sign up for internet access and they're like "Here's a subnet of 100 IPs. Have fun."
16:55         daevski_ | JavaAtom, so no external internal BS? just subdomains of subdomains in a certain block of addresses?
16:55         daevski_ | JavaAtom, BS = bullshit.
16:55         daevski_ | o.O

16:57         JavaAtom | daevski_: yes.
16:58         helgikrs | msierks: his problem seems to have been with the sata controller
16:58         daevski_ | awesome thanks
16:58         andrew12 | What filesystem should /boot be?
16:58         JavaAtom | Well, scj is right, but for conceptual purposes, you can just consider it "everybody has public IP addresses."
16:58          msierks | helgikrs, hmmm
17:00         JavaAtom | I still find it funny that people are writing news points about "the end of IP4 address space" and how it's going to happen in a year or two (or three, etc)
17:00         helgikrs | JavaAtom: will probably take longer than that
17:01         JavaAtom | helgikrs: I'd just appreciate it if we made the switch and called it good.
17:01         JavaAtom | helgikrs: But the current implementations are pretty shoddy anyway.
17:02              scj | JavaAtom: funny why?
17:02            ross` | can someone help me
17:02         helgikrs | JavaAtom: there is no support for ipv6 where i live
17:02            ross` | im trying to get my second monitor to work
17:02            ross` | i ran [ross@xps ~]$ xrandr --output VGA1 --right-of LVDS1
17:02           soreau | ross`: Which video card do you have?
17:02            ross` | it didnt give any errors
17:02         JavaAtom | scj: Because, while public IPs may shift or be reduced, most companies don't really care about that.
17:02            ross` | but it didnt work
17:02         daevski_ | yes, ross`, most of us can
17:02         helgikrs | ross`: nvidia?
17:02            ross` | no, just a laptop
17:02         JavaAtom | scj: And until the companies give a damn, the regular populace won't either.
17:03              scj | JavaAtom: yes. but they will run out eventually
17:03            ross` | i read the xorg wiki on archlinux.org
17:03            ross` | it told me to do that xrandr command, i did that
17:03           soreau | ross`: Can you pastebin the output of xrandr?
17:03            ross` | but the monitor still wont show anything, do i need to have it in xorg.conf
17:04            ross` | soreau: it just lists my monitor VGA1 and my laptop pane LVDS1
17:04            ross` | oh and DVI1
17:04           soreau | ross`: pastebin. output. | nm
17:04         JavaAtom | scj: Agreed. I just wish they'd set a timeline instead of waiting for the dam to break.
17:05              scj | JavaAtom: so what is funny about people writing about it?
17:05            ross` | ok
17:06            ross` | foo.mx/~ross/xrandr
17:06             Len_ | there is plenty of room in ip4
17:06             Len_ | if only it was used sparingly
17:06         JavaAtom | scj: I find it funny because people have known about it for a long time,
17:07         JavaAtom | scj: And writing about it is like writing about global warming - nobody is going to give a damn until the sky turns black or their AC/Heater can't keep up.
17:07             Len_ | where does most of the address space go?
17:07          msierks | helgikrs, it appears i can disable hpet in the bios, I will attempt to do that when I get home and see if that solves the problem
17:07            ross` | soreau: ?
17:07           soreau | ross`: I have to go. g/l
17:07            ross` | lol
17:07            ross` | cmonn
17:08              scj | JavaAtom: ur weird
17:08         JavaAtom | scj: I know that. Why are you writing about it? :-p
17:09            ross` | can someone help me with this?
17:11         fogobogo | ross`: what is it, poor soul?

17:12           phrik | ross`: Don't just say It doesn't work . Give the exact error. If you think more information than a line or two will be useful, paste the output to http://pastie.org

17:14           ross` | that didnt work
17:14           ross` | xrandr --output VGA1 --right-of LVDS1
17:14           ross` | didnt make it work

17:16           ross` | guys
17:16           ross` | i think the problem is more simple
17:16           ross` | like
17:16           ross` | no one is telling me how to just give it a resolution
17:16           ross` | which will proly make it work
17:16           Caleb | google it then
17:16           Caleb | find out for yourself
17:16       LugarSivi | why this isn't in any official repo? http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=33795 :O

17:17           Caleb | ross`: and check your xorg.conf
17:17           ross` | ok
17:17          regeya | you are using the wrong distribution (imho) if you want your hand held
17:17           ross` | do i need to add it in my xorg.conf?
17:17           ross` | i thought xrandr was enough
17:17         Borgasm | cuz it's in aur
17:17          regeya | blah.
17:17           Caleb | ross`: what video card?

17:18           ross` | i already read that
17:18           ross` | it doesnt tell me anything i dont already know or havnt tried

17:31         FliPPeh | Hey, I have an Apache server running on a little box in my room, and I use it (among other things) to server files. As I'm acessing the bare directory listing of Apache, ist there a way to have a dynamic header for directory listing? Apache's configuration allow me to use static HTML files which will be included
17:31         FliPPeh | But how can I make it dynamic?
17:31         FliPPeh | Like displaying the uptime with cowsay or something.

17:49         daevski_ | Anyone know what 'All available Arch software' means' here.... "With the ABS tree in place, an Arch user has all available Arch software at their fingertips to compile from source,"
17:49        MrElendig | looks like a missing icon tho
17:49         daevski_ | Does that mean the devs are making things 'available' and compatable with arch?
17:49        MrElendig | daevski_: anything in the repos
17:50         daevski_ | MrElendig, and that's maintained by the top-dogs?
17:50        MrElendig | daevski_: abs provides the PKGBUILDS and so on for all the packages in the repos
17:51        MrElendig | !give daevski_ wiki abs

17:51        MrElendig | JavaAtom: if you are talking about edid, it's always hex
17:51        agroschim | MrElendig: hm
17:51        agroschim | okay
17:52        MrElendig | agroschim: if I misread the german correctly
17:52             rxvt | ive got to find myself something similar to dreamweaver =\
17:52        agroschim | MrElendig: there is a file missing
17:52        agroschim | but i wonder why
17:52            hiato | rxvt: dreaweaver 2?
17:53          doc_who | nvu?
17:53         evaryont | rxvt: vim?
17:53         evaryont | :P
17:53             rxvt | ;p
17:55         -!- Ypsy is now known as YPSY
17:56         daevski_ | MrElendig, yeah, that's what I was reading.
17:56         JavaAtom | MrElendig: Nah, I was talking about full serial control. (Power On, Power Off, switch input, etc.)
17:57         daevski_ | rxvt, I'm using NetBeans after using dreamweaver for years
17:58         daevski_ | rxvt, it's the only alternative I've liked, so it's the only one I'd recommend.
18:00         andrew12 | pop. how do i install grub without having to do everything in the installer that you have to do before you can install grub? i already did all of that, but i just rebooted it.
18:01            quitr | grub-install
18:01         andrew12 | (ignore the "pop. ", it was just something random i felt like putting in there)
18:01         andrew12 | quitr: that just gives the usage. :\
18:01            quitr | right
18:01            quitr | read the usage
18:01         daevski_ | andrew12, you mean like, native grub install?
18:01            quitr | and use it
18:02         andrew12 | "could not find device for /boot"
18:02            tapio | where can I get a hold of wine-1.1.36-1-i686.pkg.tar.gz ?
18:02            quitr | cache
18:02            tapio | I don't have it :-\

18:03         andrew12 | quitr: grub-install hd0,2 - and grub-install /dev/sda3
18:03          sodapop | is there any solution for the thunar click problem
18:03         andrew12 | both gave the same error
18:03            quitr | Adjunct: doing it wrong
18:03            quitr | andrew12: ^**
18:04         andrew12 | -_-
18:04            quitr | andrew12: grub-install /dev/sda
18:04         daevski_ | andrew12, try find /boot/grub/stage1 in grub shell
18:04         daevski_ | andrew just 'grub' not grub-install
18:04         *       andrew12 is totally confused now :\
18:04            quitr | just do what i said
18:04         *        Adjunct is too
18:05         andrew12 | quitr: I
18:05         andrew12 | ugh
18:05            quitr | don't worry Adjunct, i said ur name by mistake
18:05            quitr | did i break it?
18:05         andrew12 | quitr: I'm installing this on my Mac. If I were to have it install to /dev/sda, then it would overwrite the EFI, which would be BAD
18:06         daevski_ | andrew12, if you need to install to the drive you are mounted on, then you need to reboot into liveCD so you are not mounted on that main drive.
18:06            quitr | ah
18:06            quitr | good point
18:06         andrew12 | daevski_: nothing is mounted at the moment
18:06         daevski_ | andrew12, okay
18:06         andrew12 | except for the livecd
18:06            quitr | idk how to install it non-MBR
18:06         poseidon | For some reason when I try to switch ttys I get a blank screen with a pulsating cursur at the top left
18:07         andrew12 | poseidon: there's nothing going on in those tty's
18:07         poseidon | andrew12: how can I make it so I can also log into those tty's?
18:07         andrew12 | i dunno
18:07         andrew12 | which ones are you trying?
18:07         andrew12 | F1-7 should work
18:07        Edward226 | poseidon I think its /etc/inittab
18:07         andrew12 | well, F1-6
18:08         daevski_ | andrew12, quitr, what do you mean non-MBR install of grub?
18:08         andrew12 | 7 is usually used for X
18:08         andrew12 | daevski_: mac uses GUID or something
18:08        Edward226 | poseidon can you pastebin your /etc/intitab
18:09         andrew12 | anyways, i just want to install grub to a parition, instead of an entire disk. it should still work the same.. i had done this with ubuntu before.
18:09        Edward226 | */etc/intittab
18:09         andrew12 | I may have to use LILO
18:09         daevski_ | andrew12, okay. I have not ever done that. Have you tried from grub shell?
18:09        andrew12 | daevski_: I haven't tried to install from grub shell, no.
18:09           quitr | daevski_: i mean installing grub, but not installing it to the master boot record
18:09           hiato | andrew12: experimentall, tried grub2?
18:09        andrew12 | brb
18:10           quitr | which is what andrew12 wants
18:10        andrew12 | going to ssh to this pc from my living room so i dont need to keep running back and forth :p
18:10           quitr | lol
18:10        daevski_ | andrew12, you can enter the shell by typeing 'grub' you will see grub> ... then try 'find /boot/grub/stage1' once there
18:10           hiato | quitr: that should be possible, IIRC, and then you get a different booot medium to boot that partition which boots grub
18:10           quitr | right, i know it's possible
18:10           quitr | i just don't know how cause i've never done it
18:10           quitr | if you know how, direct all thoughts to andrew12
18:11           quitr | imma take a nap
18:11        andrew12 | k
18:11        daevski_ | andrew12, Oh I see what you mean now. I'm still guiding you to install to MBR. Sorry
18:11        andrew12 | That's fine
18:11           hiato | quitr: All I know is that puppy linux does it. It has some or other script as part of lhe grub manager - perhaps give it a try
18:11        andrew12 | I think that will work
18:11        andrew12 | IIRC
18:12        andrew12 | and to that thing about the find...bleh, file not found.
18:12        poseidon | Edward226:

18:13           hiato | andrew12: I'm not sure hew desperate you are, but a puppy live cd can install grub for you as you describe it :P
18:13       Edward226 | poseidon taking a look
18:13         -!- stojic_ is now known as stojic
18:13        daevski_ | andrew12, right, that makes sense, cause you don't have gruib installed yet. :-\
18:13        andrew12 | hiato: haha... i'm willing to try that
18:14        andrew12 | or, i can just download grub and install it..
18:14        andrew12 | but puppy sounds like more fun, so let's do that
18:14        andrew12 | :p
18:14           hiato | sweet
18:14        andrew12 | going to reboot into osx, brb

18:16        andrew12 | yes.
18:16           hiato | andrew12: 64bit?
18:16        andrew12 | that would be interesting, but no thanks.
18:16           hiato | ok
18:17        andrew12 | usually that makes it more difficult :P
18:17           hiato | heh, too true
18:17        andrew12 | with OS X at least
18:17        andrew12 | thunder D:

18:18           hiato | i can get a smaller one if you prefer, but as it stands it's only 100m
18:18           hiato | wait, probably a newer kernl would be better

11:47 Join to #archlinux was synced in 22 secs
11:47           wonder | kossan, first because dbus is not started
11:47           kossan | fogobogo: Hehe..
11:47           kossan | wonder: I'm sure it is
11:47       JohnCantor | yeah, the dbus part fails apparently because of dbus connection
11:48           wonder | second, you should get rid of that crap and use oss
11:48       JohnCantor | sorry, the bluetooth part
11:48       Wunderkind | wonder: oss doesn't always work
11:48       JohnCantor | wonder: why so?
11:48           wonder | Wunderkind, pulse doesn't always work too
11:48         fogobogo | JohnCantor: its... sane...
11:48           kossan | wonder: Well, i'm going with alsa in that case
11:48           wonder | !pulse
11:48       Wunderkind | also is better
11:48       JohnCantor | wonder: i ask because i'm trying to build a DAW under arch
11:48           wonder | !pulseaudio
11:48            phrik | do we really need this? http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/linuxaudio.png
11:48       Wunderkind | alsa
11:49       Wunderkind | i haven't used pulseaudio for a while
11:49         shf10105 | oO, ruby18 has been removed, or did i miss it somewhere?
11:49         fogobogo | Wunderkind: it has a shitty api no one knows to code wiht
11:49           wonder | i never used pulseaudio
11:49           wonder | if i have to chose between pulse and die, i chose to die!
11:49           wonder | :D
11:49       Wunderkind | i wouldn't allow you to die wonder
11:49       Wunderkind | :D
11:49         fogobogo | Wunderkind: alsa fails often enough in my book
11:50            yitz_ | I chose pulseaudio...
11:50         fogobogo | just ask people with intel hda
11:50       Wunderkind | i'd use oss if i could get it to work with my hardware
11:50       JohnCantor | any other option to stream audio from pc to pc?
11:50         fogobogo | JohnCantor: cat
11:50            yitz_ | It got my bin32-skype to work! It was pulseaudio or reinstalling 32 bit!!
11:50           wonder | use a stereo cord :D
11:51       JohnCantor | fogobogo: cat?
11:51         fogobogo | netcat if you prefer
11:51       JohnCantor | fogobogo: could you explain, if you have time, how do i do that?
11:52         fogobogo | netcat file.mp3 <to> IP
11:52         fogobogo | anwyas
11:52         fogobogo | streaming isnt a new thing
11:52         fogobogo | and whilst pulse does a theoretical great job in that regard...
11:53         fogobogo | ..it just doesnt work and no one really needs it
11:53              ify | l
11:53              ify | Hey guys, anyone know if there is a way to get the current desktop you are looking at from the terminal?
11:53              ify | I am using compiz, so its like I have one really big viewport
11:53       JohnCantor | fogobogo: it works here. yeah, it took A LOT of work but it works. we have alsa + jack + pulse running right now
11:54          daevski | ify, what do you mean?
11:54         fogobogo | JohnCantor: but would you agree that is an everyday application ?
11:54              ify | I want to write a quake terminal script, I want it to display my terminal on my current desktop
11:54       JohnCantor | fogobogo: i'm not trying to prove anything, i'm just interested in hearing opinions and everything since we are trying to make a reasonable DAW w/ only linux stuff
11:55         fogobogo | JohnCantor: point is. 999 out of 1000 just want to hear the moaning of the nekkid ladies
11:55         fogobogo | not stream it to the wifes comp
11:55       JohnCantor | fogobogo: true. but when we tried pulse for the first time on two ubuntu-loaded machines, streaming worked out of the box
11:55       JohnCantor | fogobogo: i assume we have been lucky
11:55           wonder | JohnCantor, sorry for this n00b question i'm not into sound things but what purpose does jack has?
11:55          daevski | ify, it's likely tty7 and Display 0, but I'm not sure how you can check.
11:55         fogobogo | sure its nice but what is it good for
11:55           wonder | why is used?
11:56       JohnCantor | wonder: well i'm a noob on linux too, but to answer your question:
11:56       JohnCantor | wonder: it's... sort of a layer that stays on top of alsa
11:56              ify | Alrighty, I didnt think there was a way =(
11:56       JohnCantor | wonder: allows you to route sound from app to app with real low latency
11:56          daevski | ify, if you mean 'current desktop' as in workspaces or virtual desktops, that depends on your Window Manager
11:57       JohnCantor | wonder: i wouldn't date to say it is easy to set up but once it is, it's fantastic
11:57              ify | Yeah, thats what I mean
11:57       JohnCantor | *dare
11:57         fogobogo | JohnCantor: what. for.
11:57              ify | I am using compiz, so its like I have one really big viewport
11:57          daevski | ify, what are you using? openbox, kde, compiz, gnome?
11:57           wonder | ok
11:57              ify | So if I want to display on desktop 2, I use 1951 as my X
11:57              ify | since I have 1950x1200 resolution
11:57              ify | I mean 1921
11:58           wonder | basically it would be more easy to record the sound that you hear or the one generated from an app
11:58         fogobogo | JohnCantor: i just see no use for it. 15 minnutes fun and then?

11:59           wonder | i supposed jack is the case here
11:59         fogobogo | JohnCantor: ok. what if i dont have a studio?

12:00         fogobogo | JohnCantor: r u britnay speers?
12:00       JohnCantor | fogobogo: no, why?
12:00         fogobogo | with a studio, a mansion and 3 boxes
12:00     sledgehammer | rofl
12:01       JohnCantor | fogobogo: no mansion, 3 boxes made from old components
12:01         fogobogo | JohnCantor: anyways. couldnt nfs do the same?
12:01       JohnCantor | fogobogo: and the studio is not mine, it's something i'm working on with my company, trying to achieve decent sound quality on linux
12:01         fogobogo | the only differnce would be which box decodes
12:01       Wunderkind | sounds like a good project JohnCantor
12:02       JohnCantor | fogobogo: true, but then you'd have no single "controller" box
12:02       Wunderkind | do you have a website/pics of the studio JohnCantor?
12:02       JohnCantor | fogobogo: and usability is a goal here
12:02       JohnCantor | Wunderkind: i need to ask if we can publish them yet
12:02       Wunderkind | ok, no worries
12:02       Wunderkind | don't want anyone getting into trouble
12:03         fogobogo | JohnCantor: i support your goal there. but i still think pulse is overengineered and not for basic mortals
12:03         fogobogo | s/basic/simple
12:04       JohnCantor | sorry guys, power los
12:04       JohnCantor | Wunderkind: i'll try to post some pictures as soon as i can
12:05       Wunderkind | cool
12:05       JohnCantor | anyway, as far as i can see (warning: noobie!) linux audio is a real mess
12:05       Wunderkind | ok, maybe a silly question but is there any reason to  stream audio via icecast when mpd has built in http streaming support?
12:06           heftig | JohnCantor: a mess?
12:06           heftig | Wunderkind: it would allow you to run icecast and mpd on two different servers
12:07       JohnCantor | Wunderkind: i don't know how, never tried either of the two
12:07           heftig | e.g. stream to an icecast server with a 100mbit connection from your puny dsl home line
12:07       JohnCantor | heftig: yeah. a real mess.
12:07       Wunderkind | ok, i think i understand
12:08       Wunderkind | so icecast ftw?
12:08       JohnCantor | heftig: not as in "things do not work" but as in "things are scattered all over and it is hard to integrate them"
12:08       Wunderkind | is that what you're saying heftig?
12:08           heftig | JohnCantor: I agree we lack consensus
12:08            rooob | wow, why doesn't my shift or control key work/
12:08       JohnCantor | heftig: a large part of that must be my newbieness
12:08            rooob | i can't freaking type a question mark/
12:08            rooob | so how do i ask questions oh noes///
12:09           kossan | save
12:09            yitz_ | rooob: copy/paste
12:09            rooob | it's not a hardware thing because neither left nor right buttons work
12:09       JohnCantor | heftig: but i noticed that the net is full of questions on linux audio, so something must be wrong here
12:09            rooob | yitz_, yeah that still works ok
12:09            yitz_ | rooob: Here: ?
12:09            yitz_ | rooob: And ! too
12:10            rooob | oh you mean question marks.. lol.. i got it
12:10            rooob | why the f is my keyboard being stupid. were there hw driver updates/
12:10       JohnCantor | rooob: are you on a laptop?

12:11            rooob | thinpad x61
12:11            rooob | and the keyboard thing is periodic
12:11           pespin | in which packages can I find "locate" and "iwconfig" ?
12:11            rooob | i wonder if it's temperature..

12:25            rooob | pespin, actually, just read the wiki.. you need iwlfifi for intel stuff
12:25            rooob | bye..
12:26           pespin | uhm but the wifi card is an atheros one theoretically...

12:47           anrxc | which ones, those owned by root? :)
12:49          pespin | do I need to set anything more than "defaults,user" options in fstab in an ext4 partition in order to be able to execute an script inside this partition as a user? I'm getting "Permission denied" if I try to run the file inside a dir in that partition, but works ok in my home dir
12:50           anrxc | pespin: cat /proc/mounts and check for noexec
12:50          pespin | yep, it's noexec
12:50          pespin | do I need to add "exec" option or similar?
12:51           anrxc | well, that's the reason, you need exec

13:05          int3__ | hi there. when I run makepkg on a custom pkgbuild, it fails if it finds any missing dependencies
13:05       plutonian | I use wicd if that makes a difference
13:05          int3__ | should it fail? i had the impression that it would pull in the necessary packages from the repos
13:06          int3__ | ==> Missing Dependencies:

13:11       plutonian | anrxc: that doesnt' seem to be working for me
13:13       plutonian | it's looking for a program called ntpdate that doesn't exist
13:14       the_gamer | i'm just trying to do a syu and pacman says "warning: kbluetooth: local version (4.0.4RC2-1) is newer than extra (0.4.2-1)". did they get new version numbers?
13:16          tzervo | plutonian: wicd had such an option, I think
13:17         Lartza_ | How the hell do I use vi??
13:17         Lartza_ | :S
13:17         Lartza_ | crontab -e ...
13:17       the_gamer | i mean that is not a small difference...
13:17         Lartza_ | I can't write
13:17          tzervo | plutonian: in wicd-curses interface, in the prefs I have a boc checked which says: Always switch to wired connection when available
13:17          tzervo | plutonian: I assume there is a similar option in the gui
13:18          tzervo | Lartza_: maybe the $EDITOR variable is wrongly set?
13:18            MVXA | anyone here who could tell me if I'm allowed to patch an apache 2.0 licensed project via PKGBUILD in order to make it buildable?
13:18         Lartza_ | tzervo: Crontab uses vi :/
13:18         Lartza_ | I just realized EDITOR though yea :)
13:18       the_gamer | Lartza_: lol, no file uses an editor, it's the other way round
13:19          tzervo | Lartza_: from man " crontab will use the editor specified by your EDITOR or VISUAL environment variable"
13:19         Lartza_ | the_gamer: crontab is a command too...
13:19         Lartza_ | Okey :)
13:19       the_gamer | Lartza_: yeah, a command to edit the file with the editor
13:19         Lartza_ | Well, is crontab lost in reboot or halt?
13:20          tzervo | I guess it is "lost" when the daemons (cron) are shut down
13:20       bearman51 | Lartza_: vimtutor
13:20          tzervo | sorry ,you meant the file...
13:20            myki | Hello. I have non-standard usb keyboard with F keys up to F19. I created appropriate .Xmodmap file, and I want it loaded as I connect the keyboard to my laptop. So i created udev rule with RUN+="/usr/local/bin/usb_keyboard.sh". usb_keyboard.sh contains line: "xmodmap /home/myki/.Xmodmap". The problem is that, when I run "xmodmap /home/myki/.Xmodmap" it works correctly mapping F13-F19. But when it's called from the script it doesn't work. Why i
13:20          tzervo | it is not
13:21         Lartza_ | tzervo: So, I use crontab -e and reboot, the new cron that gets executed on boot has the same jobs on it?
13:21          tzervo | it should, yes
13:21          tzervo | mine does
13:21       plutonian | tzervo: the option exists, but it doesn't seem to do anything
13:21         Lartza_ | Hmm... how do I make cronjob for every x hoursd?
13:21         Lartza_ | *hours
13:22          tzervo | plutonian: maybe a bug, I also vaguely recall mine not functioning sometimes, youre sure you can;t get ifplugd?
13:22       plutonian | not without ntpdate
13:22          tzervo | Lartza_: 0 */X * * * command
13:22       plutonian | it exits when the cable is plugged in

13:34          tzervo | plutonian: I have just tried ifplugd and it worked for me. what happens to you? maybe you should shut down wicd befre raising ifplugd?
13:35          tzervo | plutonian: so that there are no conflicts between two managers?
13:35       plutonian | this page pretty much describes the error:

13:35           phrik | Title: [arch-general] Problems with ifplugd and net-auto-wired (at mailman.archlinux.org)
13:36          brain0 | plutonian: have you read the followups?
13:36          tzervo | plutonian: checked the first page, I also had the beep when I used ifplugd but did not load net-auto-wired.
13:36      krankkatze | hey, I'm configuring pure-ftpd and having some trouble
13:37      krankkatze | I specified in the /etc/pure-ftpd.conf that I wanted the users to be in a chroot
13:37       plutonian | brain0: yes
13:37      krankkatze | restarted the ftpd
13:37      krankkatze | and I still can cd / and ls
13:37       plutonian | nobody seemed to have a solution to the problem I'm having
13:37          brain0 | plutonian: and, did you try what was suggested?
13:37      krankkatze | could anybody help me?
13:37          brain0 | there was a suggestion by Arvid
13:37       plutonian | that was for the beep problem
13:38       plutonian | I'm not really worried about a beep on a software that I can't even use
13:38          brain0 | ah, there's another problem?
13:38       plutonian | yes, it doesn't work at all for me, the program exits with an error every time the ethernet cable is plugged in
13:38          tzervo | plutonian: you sure you don't have two network managers working together?
13:38       plutonian | tzervo: yes, wicd is disabled now
13:39       plutonian | and I run ifplugd -n, thus generating the error
13:39          brain0 | what error?
13:39       plutonian | client: up: error fetching interface information: Device not found
13:40       plutonian | and then it shows the output of ifconfig, clearly showing that my ethernet interface is eth0
13:40          tzervo | plutonian: ifplugd works by default for eth0, yours is eth0?
13:40       plutonian | yes
13:40          tzervo | oh missed the last one
13:41          brain0 | plutonian: anything in dmesg at the time?
13:42        andrew12 | hiato: yeah, i got it to work. but i accidentally made the swap partition 100gb and the root partiton 1gb instead of the other way around... it's reinstalling now
13:42        andrew12 | it worked too, which was weird.
13:42       plutonian | ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): eth0: link becomes ready
13:42          brain0 | so far it makes sense
13:43           hiato |  andrew12: bahahaaha! nicely done. How did you deo it in the end?
13:43        andrew12 | hiato: i ran the arch installer again and had it do it
13:43       plutonian | not really, it still doesn't explain why ifplugd can't find a device that's clearly there
13:43        andrew12 | and there was no error

15:21         andrew12 | yay!
15:21         fogobogo | no .pc file?
15:21         andrew12 | it worked!
15:21           jonnor | Well, unless its dead easy to use it for a part of a huge software.
15:22               nn | pkg-config/autoconf/automake all that stuff sucks giant donkey balls.
15:22         fogobogo | jonnor: sure
15:22           tasker | andrew: awesome!
15:22         andrew12 | okay, now, what's the equivilent of ubuntu's apt-get autoremove
15:22         fogobogo | jonnor: `pkg-config --libs`
15:22         fogobogo | err
15:22         fogobogo | jonnor: `pkg-config --libs sth`
15:22         andrew12 | because i need to autoremove gnome mplayer and fluxbox and then install them again
15:22         andrew12 | because ldconfig never ran for each of them
15:22         andrew12 | and their dependencies
15:22         fogobogo | andrew12: -Rh
15:22         andrew12 | k
15:23         fogobogo | hint: -Rn
15:23         andrew12 | -Rnc
15:23         fogobogo | -Rncs if you are a brave one
15:23         *       andrew12 is a brave one
15:24           jonnor | fogobogo: to explain my actual problem. I have a certain software, that I want to modify to call a function that resides in a library that I have written.
15:24         fogobogo | hmm
15:24         andrew12 | here we go....
15:24         fogobogo | jonnor: so you want to link that piece to you own lib?
15:24         andrew12 | hehe, tons of errors. wee.
15:24           jonnor | fogobogo: yes
15:24         fogobogo | jonnor: LD_PRELOAD?
15:24           jonnor | and when I think about it, this is not actually a problem
15:25         fogobogo | or sed the #includes
15:25         fogobogo | plenty of options actually
15:25           jonnor | Cause I just realized that this Makefile builds one object, not one per source file
15:25         antihero | Is there a way to get nvidia glx + compiz + xorg 1.8 working together?
15:26         fogobogo | antihero: enable [testing] ?
15:26         andrew12 | yay, now i get to install them all again
15:26           jonnor | andrew12: it should probably work
15:26         fogobogo | andrew12: hows arch so far?
15:26         andrew12 | jonnor: it is. :p
15:26         andrew12 | fogobogo: it's awesome
15:27         antihero | fogobogo: Then do I have to add any config? How do I test? Do I follow compiz tutorial as normal
15:27         andrew12 | no errors so far
15:27         andrew12 | (with pacman)
15:27           jonnor | antihero: xorg 1.8 is just xorg
15:27         fogobogo | antihero: edit /etc/pacman.conf, enable testing and see if it all works
15:27           jonnor | apart from the input device config changes, and that is detailed on the arch-dev list
15:28           jonnor | as explaine by the newspost
15:28       falconindy | antihero: if you're using nvidia out of the repos, you need to add an option to your xorg.conf
15:28         fogobogo | antihero: oh well. update after enabling testing
15:28         antihero | fogobogo: I already have testing
15:28         andrew12 | what's the package for xfce?
15:28           jonnor | antihero: then what is the problem
15:28         fogobogo | andrew12: xfce4
15:28         fogobogo | antihero: alright. updated to xorg1.8?
15:28      velcroshooz | the nvidia driver out of testing doesnt need IgnoreABI any longer
15:28         antihero | [james@potatonix twisted-intro]$ sudo clyde -Q xorg-server
15:28         antihero | extra/xorg-server 1.8.0-2
15:28         fogobogo | k
15:29         fogobogo | so far so good
15:29         antihero | and nvidia is at the latest
15:29       falconindy | velcroshooz: ah, didn't see the update
15:29         antihero | So what do I need to do to test it? I want transparent terminals :\
15:29         fogobogo | antihero: see velcroshooz
15:29              vis | im having a weird problem with a smb share from my airport router
15:29      velcroshooz | ive got 1.8 and nvidia running, i cant speak for compiz
15:30         antihero | If I run the nvidia-settings thing, It tells me that I do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X Driver and to please edit my X config file
15:30         antihero | (nvidia-xconfig kills my x's ability to start, obviously)
15:30      velcroshooz | antihero, the nvidia driver still needs to be set in xorg.conf
15:30         antihero | velcroshooz: I don't have a xorg.conf, I thought 1.8 was modular
15:31      velcroshooz | antihero, afaik the nvidia driver still needs to be loaded this way - all i have in my xorg.conf is the nvidia driver
15:31              vis | its in fstab to be mounted with this line: //**********/**********/ /<in my home directory> cifs users,noauto,noatime,username=******,password=******,workgroup=*** 0 0 but I can only mount as root. the ownership for the folder belongs to a standard user
15:31         antihero | velcroshooz: can you pastebin?
15:31              vis | anyone know why?
15:31         antihero | is there a way of putting it in xorg.conf.d?
15:32      velcroshooz | antihero, its identical to this - http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Nvidia#Minimal_configuration
15:32            phrik | Title: NVIDIA - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
15:32              vis | when mounting without sudo, I get this error: "/sbin/mount.cifs: not installed setuid - "user" CIFS mounts not supported."
15:32              vis | which I don't understand
15:32              vis | :s
15:32           jonnor | antihero: nvidia-xconfig generates an xorg.conf
15:33         antihero | jonnor: that doesn't allow xorg to run :)
15:33         antihero | I'll try with just those lines
15:33              vis | i've found some bug reports with the same error, but I'm not very well-versed with networking and I don't have a clue how to fix
15:33           jonnor | sure
15:33               nn | Uh
15:33         andrew12 | going to try to run xorg now..
15:33               nn | Its basically saying it wants /sbin/mount.cifs to be owned by root and chmod u+s
15:33               nn | (Setuid root)
15:34           jonnor | otherwise you cannot have "user" CIFS mounts (whatever that is)
15:34              vis | so I just need to change ownership of that file to root?
15:34               nn | vis: ls -a1ls /sbin/mount.cifs
15:34           jonnor | there is probably a reason why its not installed setuid
15:34         andrew12 | black screen
15:35           jonnor | andrew12: configure you .xinitrc?
15:35         andrew12 | and i cant switch to a tty
15:35           jonnor | is hal running?
15:35               nn | ssh it :)
15:35              vis | yeah, hal's running
15:35         andrew12 | jonnor: no and no
15:35           jonnor | andrew12: then thats the source of the problems
15:35              vis | ah sorry
15:35         andrew12 | i see
15:35           jonnor | this is all explained in the wiki, please do read it
15:35              vis | nn: what do those ls options do?
15:35         fogobogo | !wiki hotplugging
15:35            phrik | fogobogo: Xorg Input Hotplugging - ArchWiki: <http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xorg_Input_Hotplugging>
15:36           jonnor | uhm
15:36         andrew12 | how do i kill X.. or do i have to hold power?
15:36         fogobogo | andrew12: ^
15:36         fogobogo | andrew12: hard reset
15:36         andrew12 | :(
15:36           tasker | andrew: or you can add a keyboard input section to the xorg.conf
15:36         fogobogo | ironically that trap will vanish with xorg 1.8
15:36           jonnor | meh, use ssh or magic sysrq
15:36          Polizei | andref, ssh your machine, killall -9 X, startx, ctrl-c and switch virtual terms to 2 and to 1
15:36         antihero | BitchX how I've missed you
15:36          Polizei | andrew12 *
15:36         ziarkaen | Which package creates /usr/src/linux directory?  ITs not linux-api-headers or kernel26-headers
15:36           jonnor | tasker: if you do that you must also disable hal
15:37           jonnor | or run the new udev based xorg ofc
15:37         fogobogo | !give antihero tr en ja and the superb utf-8 support!
15:37            phrik | antihero: 見事なUTF - 8サポート！ -
15:37         andrew12 | Polizei: too late
15:37           tasker | Section "ServerFlags" Option "AllowEmptyInput" "false" EndSection
15:37          Polizei | andrew12, i do this every time some flash freezes my X :-)
15:37              vis | nn: the file is already owned by root
15:37         antihero | FYI those lines I put in xorg.conf stopped X running. That said, I do need to do some updates.
15:37               nn | vis: check its perms
15:37           jonnor | ziarkaen: pacman -Qo /usr/share/linux/vmlinux
15:37          Polizei | vis, is it suid?
15:38               nn | For user mounts it has to be setuid (chmod u+s)
15:38     sledgehammer | ziarkaen, kernel26-headers provides /usr/src/linux-2.6.33-ARCH - that's as colse as you get
15:38     sledgehammer | close*
15:38         antihero | So I'll try running X once I've done those. It said that there was a module incompatilibity with nvidia
15:38         ziarkaen | I symlinked linux to that but it soesnt have fs/open.c etc.
15:38         antihero | clyde -Syu --aur is just sexy
15:38           jonnor | ziarkaen: what are you trying to do?
15:38      velcroshooz | i just always Syua ;)
15:38              vis | nn: -rwxr-xr-x
15:39     sledgehammer | ziarkaen, open.c is source code - Arch doesn;t install source code
15:39              vis | again, something I don't know by heart
15:39              vis | Polizei: suid?
15:39         ziarkaen | jonnor: look at syscall c code.
15:39          Polizei | vis, set user id upon execution.. meaning that the program can setuid(0), or the user id of it's owner
15:39           jonnor | ziarkaen: then get the kernel source code from kernel.org or similar
15:40         antihero | buh bye, back to Xchat
15:40          Polizei | vis, chmod +s <file>
15:40               nn | vis: chmod u+s /sbin/mount.cifs     will give it setuid root, note that you should research the security "history" of mount.cifs since you are making it always run as root, with user supplied arguments
15:40              vis | how would I find that ut, nn?
15:41              vis | *out, excuse me
15:41         andrew12 | is it possible to redo the latest update?
15:41               nn | http://google.com/search?q=mount.cifs+setuid+security  probably would be a good starting point, maybe toss an archlinux in there but its a pretty generic thingy
15:41            phrik | Title: mount.cifs setuid security - Google Search (at google.com)
15:41           jonnor | andrew12: what do you mean?
15:41           tasker | i think he wants to replay a -Syu
15:42         andrew12 | jonnor: last time i did pacman -Syu, there were errors with ldconfig, which is fixed now
15:42         andrew12 | but there are many packages that were updated and then broken because of ldconfig
15:42           jonnor | andrew12: reinstall the package which outputted the errors
15:42         andrew12 | bah ok
15:43     sledgehammer | just run ldconfig again
15:43           jonnor | that would probably solve the problem as well
15:43         andrew12 | what is ldconfig anyways?
15:43     sledgehammer | man ldconfig will tell you
15:44           tasker | it contains a map of all the libraries on the system so that when an app calls for something, it can be found
15:44         andrew12 | cool
15:45      velcroshooz | having issues with freenx, connects, authenticates, times out on 'downloading session information' - nx logs show me 'ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host' - yet normall ssh works fine. anyone run into this? without a more verbose error i dont know where to look
15:45      velcroshooz | it seems to hang right after the client sends the server parameters
15:46     sledgehammer | velcroshooz, check the auth log on the server
15:46         andrew12 | where can i get an example .xinitrc?
15:46     sledgehammer | the wiki
15:46         andrew12 | v.v
15:47     sledgehammer | or in your $HOME if you created your user with adduser
15:47           tasker | check in /etc/X11/xinit
15:47           tasker | there might be one there
15:48         andrew12 | tasker: yup! .d
15:48         andrew12 | tasker: yup! :D
15:49     sledgehammer | the one in your $HOME would be a more suitable starting point imo
15:49         andrew12 | sledgehammer: if only there was one there
15:49     sledgehammer | OK /etc/skel/.xinitrc
15:50          Polizei | andrew12, http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xinitrc

15:50     sledgehammer | Polizei, he doesn't like the wiki
15:50         andrew12 | sledgehammer: .. it's kind of hard to read the wiki from a tty
15:50     JohannesSM64 | no it's not, use links
15:50     sledgehammer | not this again....
15:51          Polizei | sledgehammer, me neither, but i like google sending me to it :-)
15:51         JavaAtom | elinks
15:51         JavaAtom | :-p
15:51         andrew12 | JohannesSM64: you can't copy stuff from it -.-
15:51     sledgehammer | omg you have to type stuff1 :o
15:51     JohannesSM64 | andrew12: yes you can, with tmux copy-mode
15:51         andrew12 | which is..?
15:51     JohannesSM64 | jeez..
15:52     JohannesSM64 | install tmux, it's in the man page
15:52          Polizei | andrew12, or just wget it and analyze the html with your favorite editor (i usually use nano) :-)
15:53     JohannesSM64 | no, better use links, elinks or w3m :)
15:54          Polizei | yak.. even better, use bash! :-)
15:55         -!- ROSHA is now known as RoozbehOnline
15:55     JohannesSM64 | even better: locate the machine hosting the web page, pull out the hdd and analyze the bits :)
15:56         andrew12 | you cant download something with bash
15:56      velcroshooz | just kidnap the guy that wrote the wiki. sheesh.
15:56         andrew12 | JohannesSM64: haha
15:56           jonnor | andrew12: but you can with wget
15:56           jonnor | well, actually you can download thigns with just bash also
15:56          Polizei | andrew12, you can!
15:56         andrew12 | wget is not bash
15:56         andrew12 | BUT HOW?!
15:56           jonnor | andrew12: read the socket
15:56          Polizei | bash4 has /dev/tcp pseudo devices :>
15:57         andrew12 | aww

15:57     sledgehammer | andrew12, shouldn't you be fixing your X? :)
15:57         andrew12 | im trying to ;)
15:58         andrew12 | iafter i rebooted, it gets a black screen after a few seconds
15:58         andrew12 | about the time the resolution would change
15:59         andrew12 | the console resolution
15:59           jonnor | after X start or before?
15:59         andrew12 | jonnor: before
15:59           jonnor | are you using KMS?
15:59         andrew12 | what:s that?
16:00     sledgehammer | rofl - knew you'd say that
16:00           jonnor | andrew12: I'm not gonna spoonfeed you.
16:00         andrew12 | -.-
16:00       falconindy | i've got a udev rule which does automounting of usb devices for me. it's a modified version of the ones available on the udev wiki page. however, its triggered on boot and i get dumped to a RO maintenance shell because my drives get mounted before 'mount -a' is called. Does anyone know how to avoid this? Renumbering the file (since they're read in lexical order) doesn't seem to help.
16:00           jonnor | falconindy: pastebin the exact rule will you?
16:01       falconindy | uh, sure... the "problem" is the first line though...
16:01       falconindy | KERNEL=sd[a-z][0-9]
16:01       falconindy | http://codepad.org/CZi41SjV
16:01           jonnor | Don't assume :)
16:01            phrik | Title: Plain Text code - 28 lines - codepad (at codepad.org)
16:01     sledgehammer | falconindy, if you have devices that should always be mounted at boot, use fstab - imo
16:01           jonnor | I'm with sledgehammer
16:01       falconindy | right, that's the problem
16:01       falconindy | i DO want them mounted via fstab
16:02       falconindy | but this rule mounts them BEFORE fstab is processed
16:02     sledgehammer | use fstab INSTEAD of udev rules
16:02       falconindy | ...
16:03           jonnor | he wants the udev rule for the other devices
16:03       falconindy | my "fix" has been to alter the kernel match to be sd[e-z][1-9]
16:03           jonnor | the ones that are hotplugged
16:03       falconindy | but this seems kludgy... i want something more generic
16:03           jonnor | falconindy: like what?
16:03           jonnor | falconindy: you must device how you want to match the devices
16:03     sledgehammer | I don't get the problem then. I use fstab for any permanently connected devices, and udev rules for automounting htplugged devices
16:04       falconindy | sledgehammer: right, and that's what im trying to accomplish.
16:04           jonnor | falconindy: you can probably exclude devices based on the type and/or other device attributes
16:04               nn | could you use UUID?
16:04       falconindy | bleh, that's no better than modifying the kernel match rule
16:04           jonnor | falconindy: you cant use magic if thats what you want
16:05       falconindy | well, i'm left wondering why there's no mention of anything like this on the wiki
16:05         andrew12 | so, apparently I am infeed using KMS
16:06           jonnor | andrew12: which graphics driver/card?
16:06         andrew12 | adding the i915.modeset=0 to the kernel line on boot fixed it, though. resolutipn didnt change like it usually does
16:06         andrew12 | jonnor: Intel GMA 900 or something..
16:06         andrew12 | onboard
16:06           jonnor | andrew12: note that xorg with the latest intel driver requires KMS
16:06     sledgehammer | falconindy, I have sd[a-z][0-9] in my rules, and I don't have that problem
16:07         andrew12 | well wtf?
16:07           busata | require kms?
16:07           jonnor | busata: yes
16:07         andrew12 | let me just tro to get a clean reboot
16:07           busata | oo
16:07           brain0 | yeah, the intel driver does not have code for setting modes anymore
16:07           brain0 | they removed all code from it that worked without the KMS interface
16:07           jonnor | as per version 2.9+
16:07           brain0 | yes
16:08         andrew12 | sigh
16:08         andrew12 | black screen
16:08         andrew12 | ._.
16:08           jonnor | andrew12: hit the bugtrackers
16:08           busata | unless I'm missing something, what happened to support & drivers? :p
16:08     sledgehammer | andrew12, you have a working xinitrc now?
16:08         andrew12 | sledgehammer: this is before X gets anywhere
16:08          daevski | okay... project 2... Anyone want to suggest DVD decoding software? I need to decode and re-encode for a different region.
16:08     sledgehammer | andrew12, oh yeah... forgot that bit
16:09         andrew12 | before X starts
16:09          daevski | Or at least just rip the episodes out of this dvd and make my own dvd
16:09         andrew12 | it finishes processing UDev triggers or something, then goes black like its changing resolution, comes back with nothing
16:09           jonnor | yes, its changing resolution
16:09          daevski | I have devede..... but looking for ripper app
16:09           jonnor | likely to something your screen doesnt like
16:10           yngwin | daevski: mplayer
16:10         andrew12 | that is probably true
16:10           jonnor | which again is most likely caused by a bad EEID
16:10         *       andrew12 smashes his macbook
16:10         andrew12 | what is... nevermind
16:10          daevski | yngwin, alrighty.
16:11           yngwin | something like mplayer dvd:// -v -dumpstream -dumpfile movie.vob
16:12           jonnor | andrew12: sorry, its EDID
16:12        cantabile | daevski: handbrake, if you're fine with theora or h264 in mkv or mp4 :)
16:13          daevski | cantabile, kk thanks
16:13         andrew12 | hey! it worked this time?! wtf..
16:13          daevski | cantabile, I like mkvs, that would be kewl. can those then be handled by devede ?
16:14           jonnor | andrew12: what did you change?
16:14        cantabile | daevski: no idea
16:14         andrew12 | jonnor: nothing
16:14     sledgehammer | daevski, you're copying dvds right? not converting them - unless I misunderstood you
16:14         andrew12 | jonnor: i was reading the forums and someone else is having this exact same issue
16:15         andrew12 | I think the MacBook is just picky
16:16        cantabile | daevski: oh, and if you just want to change the region, dvdshrink may be able to help you (you'll need wine)
16:16          daevski | sledgehammer, I need to take a PAL and get it (or just the episodes) into Region 1 (USA)
16:17     Philluminati | Hi guys. I'm ditching Fedora and Debian won't install so I'm thinking about installing Arch. How long does it take to do a basic install that gets me say gnome+internet+firefox?
16:17          daevski | NTSC *
16:17        cantabile | daevski: does it have to play back on a standalone dvd player?
16:17           tasker | 30~40 minutes? i think.. it's been awhile since i installed
16:17       ZenDualism | Depends on line speed I guess
16:18       ZenDualism | But yeah, an hour or so
16:18           jonnor | Philluminati: depends mostly on you
16:19           jonnor | Unless you're very proficient with GNU/Linux I'd set off a couple of hours
16:19     Philluminati | I've built a Gentoo system before
16:20          Blaargh | it'll be faster than that
16:20       ZenDualism | Way quicker than Gentoo
16:20           yngwin | about half an hour if you know what you're doing
16:20     Philluminati | I think I should understand what I want. It's just wireless and the package manager I think i'd struggle with
16:20        bearman51 | wireless will be the hardest part
16:20          Polizei | Philluminati, depending on what you're building, gentoo installs from 4-8 hours to a week or two.. my last arch install was, say, 30 minutes
16:20         JavaAtom | Arch: Awesomeness of Gentoo without the B.S.
16:21       ZenDualism | I find the install goes quick -- but it takes a bit to tweak it just how I want it (using as desktop)
16:21     Philluminati | If it took half the time of a Gentoo install it would take me about 2 days :-s
16:21         andrew12 | apt-get install -> pacman -S .. apt-get remove -> pacman -R .. apt-get update -> pacman -Syy
16:21     Philluminati | I was hoping to get something up and running quickly that'll be a stable system.
16:21         andrew12 | there's the first bit of the package manager, you shoudl read more though :p
16:21         JavaAtom | Philluminati: Thus Arch.
16:21           yngwin | check the wiki, it has very good info
16:22          Polizei | Philluminati, for the wireless basically you're stuck to wpa_supplicant, and after you install gnome or everything else, you could try networkmanager (it's complicated, though)
16:22           jonnor | Philluminati: what do you mean by stable?
16:22       ZenDualism | Install yaourt too -- makes life easier if you need any aur packages
16:22          Polizei | s/everything/anything X-ish/
16:22         *         yngwin would recommend packer over yaourt
16:22           jonnor | If by stable you mean no package changes, Arch is not that
16:22       ZenDualism | cool @ yngwin -- I must try it
16:23           pespin | hi, how can I power off bluetooth device in my eeepc 1005ha?
16:23           yngwin | when i last tried arch, about 2 years ago, yaourt was dead slow, this time (just installed a couple of days ago) i use packer, and it is so much faster
16:23          bioe007 | is -o file_mode=664,dir_mode=775 the proper way to force a cifs share to make files i create g+rw ?
16:24           tasker | i think you're looking for umask=020
16:25          bioe007 | cifs doenst honor umask
16:25         andrew12 | ok anyways, back to trying to get X to work.. is there a wiki page that will tell me how?
16:25         andrew12 | since you're probably going to tell me to go there anyways
16:26     sledgehammer | andrew12, yes the xorg page
16:26           yngwin | Philluminati: if you dont mind kde, then i can also recommend chakra, here wireless worked out of the box
16:26         andrew12 | k
16:26          bioe007 | i think the beginners guide is still best for getting x running
16:26       ZenDualism | Speaking of things being slow, my pacman seems to be slow recently, I have 788 packages installed according to -Q -- is there any housekeeping I should be doing to keep it running fast?
16:26       ZenDualism | -Sc maybe?
16:26         andrew12 | ZenDualism: remove any packages you're not using
16:27     sledgehammer | ZenDualism, that won't affect pacman's speed. run pacman-optimize
16:27       jwbirdsong | pacman-optimize
16:27       ZenDualism | thanks
16:27          bioe007 | this is whats confusing me from mount.cifs, 'if the srver does not support the cifs unix extensions this overrides the default file mode'
16:27       jwbirdsong | oh fine
16:27         andrew12 | oh no.. not this again
16:27         andrew12 | it's doing the ldconfig thing again...
16:27           jonnor | andrew12: what "thing"
16:28         andrew12 | jonnor: Cannot create cache file...invalid argument
16:28           tasker | bioe007: i guess trying it and seeing what happens will be one way to understand it a little better
16:28           jonnor | when you are doing what?
16:28          bioe007 | tasker: well im trying it, but seeing no effect
16:28         andrew12 | anything involving ldconfig, including installing a package
16:28          bioe007 | tasker: except if set umask i get an error in dmesg
16:28         andrew12 | going to reboot, see if that fixes it..
16:28     Philluminati | Sorry I'm back. Yeah by stable I mean not Fedora. I'm tired of X or my wireless breaking because they want to use some new untested kernel driver rather than well tested madwifi drivers or some such
16:28            balco | hi htere. Anyone knows a simple way to convert a video file to a swf file?
16:28           jonnor | andrew12: probably not
16:29           jonnor | Philluminati: Arch is updated continiously
16:29           jonnor | Philluminati: if upstream fucks up, we are the first to feel it
16:29           tasker | bioe007: have you looked into the "dynperm" option?
16:29          daevski | cantabile, sorry, I'm back, yes it does. It's for my mother-on-law.
16:29     Philluminati | It's been my distro for like 5 years but enough is enough. I think Arch might be a little easier on me. When things are working I'll only upgrade the little things I need
16:29     sledgehammer | balco, "a video file" is about as vague as it gets
16:30           jonnor | On the other hand, Arch is vanilla, so if upstream doesnt fuck up, there is very little chance of devs fucking it up
16:30          daevski | cantabile, (stand-alone dvd player)
16:30           jonnor | Philluminati: partial updates are not supported
16:30     Philluminati | I can upgrade a single app though right?
16:30            balco | sledgehammer: lol, well an avi file. no sound...
16:30            nand` | If I installed a package with pacman, where can I find/edit its source code?
16:30           jonnor | Philluminati: not supported
16:30           jonnor | also, Arch only ships stable versions (as defined by upstream)
16:30     Philluminati | I'm hoping I can just find a set of packages that work for me and then just stick with them
16:30         andrew12 | worked yet again, hmm...
16:30           brain0 | Philluminati: sometimes yes, but sometimes things might just break
16:31     sledgehammer | balco, ffmpeg, mencoder, transcode
16:31     Philluminati | Break more frequently or less frequently than Fedora or Gentoo?
16:31      velcroshooz | ffs is freenx a pain in the ass .. if its not one error its another
16:31           brain0 | it's is generally not recommended to update a single application
16:31          Polizei | nand`, install abs, sync it and find it in /var/abs/<repo>/<package>
16:31               nn | You could always do like i do-- use abs and keep a local package set
16:31       ZenDualism | Whenever I've had issues it's when I try to upgrade one thing without the rest
16:31               nn | Yeup
16:31           jonnor | Philluminati: depends on how you use Arch
16:31          bioe007 | tasker: didnt see that one, but when the man page says its unreliable...
16:31               nn | abs<3
16:31            balco | sledgehammer: mencoder can encode to swf?
16:31           brain0 | Philluminati: fedora takes outdated software and backports experimental unstable features to it
16:31         *          Tekku Boas pessoal <o/
16:32           brain0 | Philluminati: that can't be good
16:32     Philluminati | :-)
16:32           brain0 | Arch is definitely in constant flux, and there are times when certain parts of the system are not as stable as you'd like
16:32              scj | balco: no
16:32            nand` | Polizei, oh that makes sense. The guide I was looking at told me to edit /var/abs but I was wondering why it isn't there for me
16:32           brain0 | I think the open source ATI drivers were such a topic for the last few months
16:32           brain0 | but they seem to stabilize now
16:33              scj | balco: it can encode to flv which is a flash supported container format
16:34            balco | scj: rly? let me ask google about it
16:34             Maxa | upgrading 186 packages on a usb install takes forever :/
16:35           Kodama | yeah...Ubuntu 10.04 will be released tomorrow...joy :-)
16:35           brain0 | Philluminati: the biggest problem some people have with Arch is this: there are some big updates to essential system libraries sometimes. Due to its rolling release model, Arch deploys these updates and the required rebuilds quickly. If - when such an update occurs - you choose not to upgrade your system all at once, everything will break
16:35           brain0 | Kodama: nobody cares
16:35     sledgehammer | Kodama, woo hoo
16:35             Maxa | you joined to tell that? im just installing 2010.04.19 on netbook
16:35           wonder | Kodama, i hope the servers are crashing
16:36       ZenDualism | Does Ubuntu 10.04 have anything I don't already have? :p
16:36             Maxa | bugs
16:36       ZenDualism | lol
16:36     Philluminati | Well because I installed a DVD for Debian and it won't boot I may as a well try Arch
16:36           brain0 | and some ugly new gnome-theme
16:36          kravlin | speaking of bugs. anybody know what Disabling IRQ 17 means? because it reports that from my ethernet card.
16:36           brain0 | Philluminati: http://build.archlinux.org/isos/
16:36     Philluminati | Feels better than going straight back to Fedora for same abusive cycle.
16:36            phrik | Title: Index of /isos/ (at build.archlinux.org)
16:36           jonnor | kravlin: exactly what it says?
16:36       ZenDualism | I noticed my gnome icons all changed recently -- is this a general gnome thing?
16:36           jonnor | kravlin: what part is unclear?
16:36           wonder | ZenDualism, recently?
16:36           brain0 | those are the latest snapshots (there was going to be a release soon, but apparently some copyright dates still say 2009)
16:36          kravlin | what does Disabling IRQ #17 mean?
16:37           wonder | ZenDualism, that is done since last month
16:37       ZenDualism | Yeah recently ;)
16:37          kravlin | jonnor: what does Disabling IRQ #17 mean?
16:37           wonder | ZenDualism, you are late with updates
16:37           jonnor | kravlin: what part is unclear?
16:37           wonder | wake up!
16:37       ZenDualism | lol
16:37           wonder | :D
16:37           Kodama | finally Ubuntu with more cloud, music and app store....man I can't wait...
16:37           jonnor | kravlin: do you know what an IRQ is?
16:37       ZenDualism | I'm in Africa -- things go slow here
16:37           brain0 | kravlin: some PCI driver probably chose to disable a device - then the IRQ is disabled too
16:37     sledgehammer | Kodama, wrong channel
16:37         -!- WhiteCrow1 is now known as WhiteCrow1||AWAY
16:37         andrew12 | ugh, i have to go... i'll see you guys later :\
16:37           wonder | ZenDualism, that's the new icon theme in gnome 2.30
16:37       ZenDualism | ok cool @ wonder
16:38           wonder | Kodama, get OUT!
16:38           wonder | :D
16:38          kravlin | jonnor: no. I don't have any idea what changed between boots but now it's making my system stop working for a second every 2

16:39          daevski | cantabile, oh excellent. I'm going to start that small project tomorrow, but that is great news. Thanks for reading into it.
16:39             Maxa | well.. maybe he was just being sarcastic :/
16:39           brain0 | maybe he was just being annoying
16:39     sledgehammer | s/maybe//
16:39          kravlin | brain0: if it's disabling a PCI device why does it make my computer freeze for a second?
16:39           wonder | we love you tigr:P
16:39          daevski | cantabile, I have used devede a lot, so I think I know how I can do that.
16:39           brain0 | there are at least 3 serious Arch-related conversations going on here simultaneously, can't have that disturbed by a ubuntu fanboy
16:39          bioe007 | this must be sth on the server causing these perms to be wacky
16:40           brain0 | kravlin: depends, can't think of an obvious reason right now
16:40          bioe007 | might reroute bus
16:40           jonnor | kravlin: that the kernel is disabling an IRQ can be entirely harmless and expected, or it can be a symptom of a problem
16:40           jonnor | kravlin: pastebin your dmesg if you want us to look at it
16:40          kravlin | jonnor: will do.

16:45          kravlin | jonnor: I can't get the full file on from here. give me a couple hours and i'll be in a postion to connect the computer to the net
16:45          kravlin | brain0: sure
16:45           jakubo | cause yesterday x wouldnt start
16:46           jakubo | just need to execute the nvidia xconfig? or what the command is

16:46           jakubo | hmm ok
16:46           brain0 | you don't even need to configure it anymore
16:46           jakubo | ltes see
16:46      GraveDigger | ...
16:46           brain0 | just install latest nvidia and xorg-server from testing and launch X
16:47           jakubo | k cya
16:47           brain0 | I just made a change earlier that allows Xorg to automatically use nvidia without a config file
16:47           wonder | +1
16:47           wonder | i had a talk with ise before you joined
16:47           wonder | now i can really get rid of xorg.conf
16:48           brain0 | qt apps still break with nvidia, unless you specify some Fonts section - I don't understand it, but now I know why Pierre's fonts were all messed up while mine just worked fine
16:48           brain0 | when I deleted my xorg.conf, my fonts were messy too
16:48          kravlin | jonnor, brain0: I
16:48          kravlin | jonnor, brain0: I'll have to come back to this later. Thanks for your help.
16:48           brain0 | np
16:48           wonder | don't have fonts path in my xorg.conf
16:49           brain0 | wonder: the problem is ONLY with qt
16:49           wonder | gtk rulz then:D
16:49           brain0 | non-qt apps work. and qt works on non-nvidia
16:49      velcroshooz | so you dont need xorg.conf with nvidia now?
16:49           brain0 | and qt says it's nvidia's fault, nvidia says it's qt's fault
16:49           brain0 | velcroshooz: you need the latest packages from testing
16:49           wonder | brain0, you didn't release it
16:49           wonder | :D
16:50      velcroshooz | brain0, yeah i got all that, only thing in my xorg.conf is the driver line for nvidia
16:50           brain0 | I didn't?
16:50           brain0 | FUCK
16:50           brain0 | I forgot
16:50          bioe007 | it seems if i do mount -t cifs -o nounix <src> <dest> i get the 'proper' response to file_mode/dir_mode options
16:50          bioe007 | does cifs inherit the clien'ts permissions somehow?
16:50      velcroshooz | id be all about dumping it completely though
16:50           brain0 | okay, very sorry, I forgot to actually release the package to the repositories
16:50     philluminati | :-s I have to write all these configuration files?
16:51           brain0 | it puts this file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ http://repos.archlinux.org/wsvn/packages/nvidia-utils/trunk/20-nvidia.conf - combined with xorg-server 1.8, that does the trick
16:51            phrik | Title: Arch Linux Repositories - packages - Rev 78857 - /nvidia-utils/trunk/20-nvidia.conf (at repos.archlinux.org)
16:51           jonnor | philluminati: what config files?
16:51           wonder | waiting the package to test it
16:51           brain0 | wonder: uploading now
16:51           brain0 | wonder: I actually tested on the desktop, but had the package files on the laptop
16:52            nand` | chkfontpath: command not found - Which package is it in?
16:52           brain0 | I told myself to run testingpkg as soon as I returned to the laptop
16:52           wonder | i should see if composite is enabled by default
16:52           brain0 | and then I forgot
16:52           brain0 | wonder: it is
16:52           wonder | cool
16:52           wonder | then bye bye xorg.conf :D
16:53     philluminati | rc.conf, fstab, etc during the install
16:53   DarwinSurvivor | I seem to be getting this bug http://code.google.com/p/pyodbc/issues/detail?id=41 Shouldn't the version in arch have the fix already...?
16:53            phrik | Title: Issue 41 - pyodbc - .Execute returns an integer rather than a cursor object - Project Hosting on Google Code (at code.google.com)
16:53           wonder | i can say that i don't configure anything related to xorg :)
16:53           jonnor | philluminati: you should review/edit them, but not write them from scratch
16:53           wonder | gnome is doing that automatically for touchpad
16:54     philluminati | Mine are empty :-s
16:55           jonnor | DarwinSurvivor: that package is in aur, but sure
16:55           wonder | philluminati, you don't have to do anything
16:55           jonnor | DarwinSurvivor: note that the dev says he think he fixed the problem
16:55      velcroshooz | is anyone here running a WM through freeNX? ive been through the wiki about the workarounds when your not using KDE/Gnome, short of installing a DM. I get the startup icon and just a blank screen currently.
16:55   DarwinSurvivor |  jonnor: No it's not: http://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/mysql-python/
16:55           wonder | just install arch and follow every menu from the installer
16:55            phrik | Title: Arch Linux - mysql-python 1.2.3c1-2 - Package Details (at www.archlinux.org)
16:55           wonder | philluminati, /arch/setup
16:56           wonder | you should really read beginners guide or official installation guide
16:56           brain0 | wonder: up now
16:56   DarwinSurvivor | jonnor: sorry, forgot to mention i'm getting the same bug with a different library :P
16:56           wonder | brain0, got it
16:56     philluminati | yeah well I have to install something
16:56           jakubo | hmm... i got crappy 800x600 screen resolution still
16:57           jonnor | DarwinSurvivor: if its another library you are not getting the same bug
16:57   DarwinSurvivor | jonnor: ok
16:57           jonnor | you migth be getting the same symptoms tho
16:57   DarwinSurvivor | still got similar symptoms though :(
16:58   DarwinSurvivor | i was wondering if they bugs could be related somehow
16:58           jonnor | why would they, do they share code+
16:58      velcroshooz | brain0, is it the new mesa, or is it a diff package?
16:58           wonder | brain0, works
16:58           wonder | horay
16:59   DarwinSurvivor | jonnor: hmm, nvm, i thought one of them was a dep for the other, guess not
16:59           brain0 | velcroshooz: new nvidia-utils
16:59   DarwinSurvivor | darn, so much for using python to move some data between DB's :(
16:59           brain0 | velcroshooz: it might hit the first mirrors within an hour or so
16:59           jonnor | DarwinSurvivor: fix/file, don't ignore
16:59      velcroshooz | brain0, aah okay. be awhile then.
17:00           jakubo | am i doing anything wrong? i still got crappy resolution
17:00           jakubo | nvidia, not nouveau right?
17:00           brain0 | velcroshooz: I thought I added the package 3 hours ago, but I actually forgot to upload it
17:01           brain0 | so just remove the ban, so he stops annoying me
17:01  mode/#archlinux [+o tigr] by ChanServ

17:01  mode/#archlinux [-o tigr] by tigr
17:01      velcroshooz | brain0, no worries. someone i was helping with earlier asked about this, and i said afaik you still needed the nvidia driver in xorg.conf, so this is definitelty nice
17:02           brain0 | yes, I just realized a few hours ago how easily we can fix that
17:02           jonnor | if only they get good xrandr support and things would be nice
17:02           brain0 | that reminds me, I need to reply to their latest email
17:02           jakubo | hmm guys?
17:03           jonnor | jakubo: yes?
17:03           brain0 | I am in direct contact with an nvidia employee about their linux driver
17:03           jakubo | am i doing anything wrong? i still got crappy resolution
17:03           jonnor | really? Officially or unoffically?
17:03           brain0 | whatever, they wrote us emails about improving cooperation between arch and nvidia

11:57           heftig | velcroshooz: pulseaudio takes a full DE?
11:58      velcroshooz | no, but by the time you have it and the bluetooth tools youve basically pulled in half of one anyway
12:00      velcroshooz | maybe i can get away with less in arch, ill have to try. last time i attempted the latency between the bluetooth stack and pulse was horrible, and unresolvable
12:00          gnubien | velcroshooz: asked in #pulseaudio?
12:02      velcroshooz | no .. im gonna try not to use it this time if possible. i was just ranting, havent started working on that yet. still need to fix freenx first :/
12:04      velcroshooz | is anyone here running a WM through freeNX? ive been through the wiki about the workarounds when your not using KDE/Gnome (specifically starting with .xinitrc and a new VD), short of installing a DM. I get the startup icon, then just a blank screen currently.

12:39        SmartWish | DAEMONS=("syslog-ng dbus hal slim network netfs crond")
12:39      velcroshooz | dont even need IgnoreABI anymore

12:40            intgr | SmartWish: Don't add "" around all of them
12:40        cantabile | I'm just saying, if it no longer works someone should update the factoid (it is a factoid, right?)
12:40           wonder | velcroshooz, you don't even need an xorg.conf anymore :D
12:40      velcroshooz | nope
12:40         helgikrs | velcroshooz: :O omg omg omg omg, i'm on it
12:40            intgr | SmartWish: DAEMONS is supposed to be an array of strings, not array of one string
12:40             Tera | can I resize NTFS during Arch's installation?
12:40        reventon_ | SmartWish, what happens exactly when you turn on the comp, walk us through it
12:40        SmartWish | Sorry, i wrote wrong, it wasn't :""
12:40           wonder | SmartWish, stop using slim
12:41           wonder | most problems are because of it
12:41        SmartWish | What should i use?
12:41           wonder | gdm
12:41        reventon_ | i love slim, works great
12:41           wonder | yeah sure
12:41            intgr | Tera: Not so easily
12:41         *      SmartWish is confused
12:41         helgikrs | slim is fine, but it can be a pain in the but
12:41             Tera | wonder: inittab ftw :)
12:41        SmartWish | I got gdm installed too
12:41           wonder | reventon_, start using an app that needs gnome-keyring
12:41           wonder | :D
12:41        reventon_ | why? i don't even have gnome installed on my machine
12:42      velcroshooz | helgikrs, with new nvidia-utils (thanks to brain0) you dont even neeed to specify the nvidia driver in xorg.conf anymore - im running without one
12:42         EmoSpice | you may also try lxdm, if you like slim
12:42        SmartWish | I try gdm first
12:42           wonder | SmartWish, so is a problem with x being configured poorly?
12:42        reventon_ | you still havent' told us what the problem is
12:42        SmartWish | First arch loads, then i get my login screen, then i get terminal
12:42         helgikrs | velcroshooz: ah, nice -- so xorg1.8 is working out of the box with no configuring and using nvidia driver? sounds too good to be true
12:42           wonder | SmartWish, also why did you added all daemon inside quotas?
12:43           wonder | SmartWish, that may be a problem since " " is like a single object
12:43      velcroshooz | helgikrs, if you were using hal fdi's to manage inputs, then some modification is required to switch to udev - touchpads may be the same, dont know for sure. otherwise everything is working on my desktop ootb
12:43        reventon_ | wonder, he said they aren't actually in quotes
12:43        SmartWish | I wrote wrong, it's without quotes
12:43           wonder | ok
12:44        bearman51 | #archlinux-war
12:44           wonder | SmartWish, get rid of slim from daemons and use inittab way
12:44         helgikrs | velcroshooz: i might be using fdi to set the keyboard layout, but can't remember, nothing important atleast, guess i'll have to check xorg1.8 out =D
12:44            intgr | How come I still get this?
12:44            intgr | newaliases: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.0.9.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
12:44        SmartWish | inittab?
12:45            intgr | And yes I have updated postfix, and removed/reinstalled
12:45           wonder | intgr, restart postfix
12:45        SmartWish | replace slim with inittab?
12:45            Sagan | wonder: why inittab? is it faster?
12:45            Noble | What values should I set on HorizSync and VertRefresh on a LCD screen?
12:45            intgr | wonder: I just get two lines with "FAIL"
12:45        SmartWish | I get a flash of an X error, but the loginterminal comes then
12:45      velcroshooz | Noble, its specific to the screen, there is no default
12:45           wonder | Sagan, no really. but is less a problem if your xorg doesn't start
12:46            Noble | velcroshooz: Is there any hope of finding the values?
12:46        reventon_ | SmartWish, what does /var/log/Xorg.0.log say
12:46        SmartWish | 2 sec
12:46           wonder | Sagan, just passing to kernel init 3 and you are done.
12:46        reventon_ | right after you boot
12:46            intgr | wonder: It's been like this ever since the openssl ABI breakage, I just haven't bothered to fix it so far.
12:46           wonder | intgr, no problem here
12:46      velcroshooz | Noble, google maybe, dont know for sure - ive not had to meddle with it
12:46            intgr | Yeah, no problem on my other machines either
12:46            Sagan | wonder: I"ll try it.
12:46        SmartWish | It doesn't exist
12:46            intgr | So any ideas?
12:46        SmartWish | That log
12:46           wonder | intgr, do lsof | grep libssl.so.0.9.8
12:46           wonder | see what process does it use it
12:47           wonder | also be sure you are fully up to date
12:47            intgr | wonder: Nobody uses it
12:47            intgr | I've rebooted a bazillion times since the openssl upgrade
12:47           wonder | ok
12:47            intgr | postfix-2.7.0-3
12:47           wonder | works for me
12:47        reventon_ | SmartWish, do 'ls /var/log', do you see anything that could be an X log?

12:52            phrik | wonder: <wonder> Magick211, "hard freeze" is what you think it is. what happens is that xorg doesn't detect any input devices because hal is not started

12:53      velcroshooz | Noble, if your on 1.7 you have no choice unless you build it. if your on 1.8 read the wiki and enable udev rules for inputs
12:53        reventon_ | SmartWish, first try "pacman -S xorg-xauth"
12:54           clutch | Kind of a noob question here, but are than any particular mirrors in mirrorlist that are better than others?  Not sure if I should just uncomment everything and let pacman sort it out or of there's a better way.
12:54        SmartWish | Ok
12:54           clutch | probably a better way lol
12:54            Noble | velcroshooz: I see.

12:55      velcroshooz | is anyone here running a WM through freeNX? ive been through the wiki about the workarounds when your not using KDE/Gnome (specifically starting with .xinitrc and a new VD), short of installing a DM. I get the startup icon, then just a blank screen currently.
12:55           clutch | thanks.  Its working, I just get a lot of errors (No Address Record) in pacman's output
12:55        reventon_ | fogobogo, ask away, i'm sure if i can't answer someone else can
12:55           clutch | ill check out the link

13:31              gik | interresting
13:32            anrxc | it doesn't kick it's ass because irssi has more users and more scripts from those users, maybe in a few more years

14:14    amir_varasteh | wonder: and is 64 faster than 32 ? is it really faster ?
14:14           wonder | depends on what you use
14:14           wonder | :D
14:14        feindbild | amir_varasteh: depends
14:14    amir_varasteh | i mean genreally
14:14    amir_varasteh | i have chakra
14:14            Janno | 64 is faster!

14:15      velcroshooz | it makes the interwebs faster and you type quicker. go now.
14:15    amir_varasteh | wonder : because removing 32 and intall 64 may have some trubels ... so what u suggest me ? continue using 32 or install 64 ?
14:16           wonder | whatever you want
14:16           wonder | i use 64 and all my favorite software are working fine
14:16        feindbild | amir_varasteh: I only use 64bit. I have no problem. only thing is that you need more disk space as for some stuff there is no 64bit version and you need to install bin32- stuff
14:16           chosig | amir_varasteh: if you compile them in a 64bit system the'll be 64bit... but the won't necessarily use the advantages...
14:17        feindbild | amir_varasteh: like wine of googleearth, skype ...

14:19        d_garbage | amir_varasteh, have a look around the web. It makes some interesting reading. There are some specific things the 64 bit app are good at. I'd say unless you do any of those things, or just want to see for yourself, 64bit isn't worth the bother. :)

15:10           linfan | maybe it is better if i makepkg and manually apply the patch
15:10           jelly1 | linfan: ?
15:11           linfan | jelly1:  How would you do to install ifuse-git from aur when you receive an error about a patch file that is incorrect in the PKGBUILD?  I pasted the error msg to AUR http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=25449

15:12           wonder | is needed?
15:13           wonder | we are thinking to add libimobile support in the future to gvfs
15:13           wonder | ifuse is used by gvfs to mount it?
15:13           wonder | what happens if it doesn't exists?
15:13           linfan | wonder: I try to see if iphone would work - but I get stuck on the patch during install

15:23        reventon_ | ah, that's what i was looking for
15:24        reventon_ | ok how do i query what packages depend on the one i passed to pacman
15:24            yitz_ | -Qi
15:24      velcroshooz | Qi will show you what it requires and what requires it
15:25        reventon_ | interesting, i'm looking at 'pacman -Qi git' and it shows 'required by: none' but 'install reason: installed as a dependency for another package'...
15:25           jelly1 | wonder: it works now!
15:25           jelly1 | thanks man
15:25           wonder | guys i really hate GNOME
15:26           wonder | gdm is broken too!
15:26           jelly1 | use KDE
15:26         scottman | why
15:26           jelly1 | developpers
15:26        reventon_ | i only use openbox + tint2
15:26        reventon_ | works great
15:26         scottman | mm tint2 is awesome
15:26           jelly1 | no panel is enough :D
15:26        ulughbegh | finaly found a photo manager: shotwell
15:26            yitz_ | reventon_: Reinstall as explicit
15:26      velcroshooz | reventon_, git is an oddball, i dont know quite whats up with that. shows orphaned on my machine too but obviously you need it to pull git vers out of aur etc
15:26           linfan | wonder: it needed obex-data-server, too - but how do I now find the iphone? nothing turns up on desktop
15:27            yitz_ | abs maybe should have a git dep?
15:27           jelly1 | yitz_: then it would have bazaar too etc.
15:27           jelly1 | so i dont think that's an option
15:27           jelly1 | *solution
15:28        moljac024 | so gdm is looking ugly in it's latest version
15:28        moljac024 | i just update
15:28        moljac024 | updated*
15:29        reventon_ | oooh right its required by packer
15:29      __dantheman | ya gdm looks pretty bad
15:29      __dantheman | but, at least it still works :p
15:29        moljac024 | and being the fool i am i cleared the pacman cache before testing everything worked
15:30          Theoden | Openbox - tint2 - slim - obmixer ... all those problems go away.  :)
15:30        ulughbegh | ob + tint2, nice couple
15:30          Theoden | yup
15:30        moljac024 | obmixer?
15:30        ulughbegh | try bmpanel also
15:30        moljac024 | i like xfce4-panel the best
15:31        ulughbegh | obmixer never hearth
15:31          Theoden | Yup - obmixer gives you a nice volume control in your tint2 systray.
15:31        moljac024 | i use an application launcher for gnome-volume-control in xfce4-panel
15:31        ulughbegh | xterm -e alsamixer, from your command runner e.g gmrun, imho best
15:32      velcroshooz | bah i just have them hotkeyed. i dont need a bar or percentage to tell me where my sound is at
15:33        ulughbegh | velcroshooz, nice
15:33           hendry | silly question: is there a "pacman lite", a .pkg.tar.gz tool for installing packages on ubuntu, slackware? otherwise I guess I can write my own. :}
15:33        moljac024 | hey bitlord
15:33        reventon_ | is obmixer AUR?
15:33          bitlord | hi moljac024
15:33      velcroshooz | yes
15:33        moljac024 | whats happening dog
15:34          Theoden | ulughbegh: obmixer is in the systray - http://98.234.161.226/opera/Musical-Openbox.png
15:35          Theoden | reventon_: obmixer is in the aur.
15:35        ulughbegh | Theoden, cheking
15:36        cantabile | hendry: .pkg.tar.gz are arch linux packages. why do you want them in ubuntu or slackware?
15:37           jonnor | reventon_: velcroshooz: thats because it was installed as a build dep
15:37           jonnor | as opposed to a runtime dep
15:37      velcroshooz | Theoden, not that ill use it but thats good to know - you should add a snippet about obmixer to the openbox section of the wiki - im sure others will find that useful
15:38        ulughbegh | Theoden, it is looking very nice
15:38          Theoden | velcroshooz: Good idea.
15:38          Theoden | ulughbegh: thx
15:38           wonder | ok
15:38           wonder | gnome devs are morons
15:39           jonnor | wonder: what now?
15:39          bioe007 | wonder: known since about 1997?
15:39           wonder | they broke gdm
15:39           wonder | because they have duplicates desktop.in files
15:39        ulughbegh | Theoden, did you code it?
15:39           jonnor | more than the 2.28 breakage?
15:39           jonnor | oh
15:39           wonder |  /builds/extra/gdm/trunk/src/gdm-2.30.2/data/greeter-autostart
15:39      __dantheman | anyone else having problems with kernel panics when installing the newest x86_64 core?
15:39          Theoden | ulughbegh: obmixer?  No I didn't.

15:39           wonder | polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1.desktop.in.in
15:39        ulughbegh | Theoden, ok
15:39           wonder | and we patch on .in but they use .in.in to generate them
15:40           jonnor | why cant you patch on .in.in ?
15:40           wonder | that is what i do now
15:40           linfan | I don't get this crap vfs and libimobliledevice - nothing happens - dmesg just tells me it found a new usb device and in rhythmbox noting pertaining to iPhone turns up
15:41         *      reventon_ away
15:41           jonnor | __dantheman: doesnt matter if other have it, you have it.

15:41           wonder | hmm
15:42           wonder | i see in Makefile.am EXTRA_DIST
15:42         markatto | apple hardware is nice in many ways. I wish other manufacturers would follow their lead with things like IPS panel lcds and laptop power connectors that don't suck

15:09          tcleval | hi, I have like 4G or more of old archlinux packages on my cache, I know I could delete some of them, the really old ones like 3 months old using the find command. But I wanna know, is there any cmd to deal with removal of old packages, like by date or size? any command on package utils?
15:11              njr | !wiki pacman
15:11            phrik | njr: pacman - ArchWiki: <http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman>
15:11              njr | pacman -Sc
15:12          tcleval | njr, that give me packages not installed, but I have multiple old kernels for example, and I need just the one I am using right now for backup, how can I remove the old versions?
15:13       xdarklight | tcleval: hang on, there's a python script somewhere
15:14       xdarklight | tcleval: http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CacheClean
15:14            phrik | Title: CacheClean - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
15:14              njr | ) tcleval: pac,am -Sc works for me
15:14       xdarklight | tcleval: just run: /path/to/the/script.py -v 1
15:14       xdarklight | then it will only keep the latest version of the packages in /var/cache/pacman/pkg
15:15          tcleval | xdarklight: I think pacman -Sc did the trick. I only have on version of the kernel. I thought It would not remove any version of the kernel becouse I have the kernel installed, it seems that pacman removes everything but the package+version you have installed
15:15        cantabile | tcleval: the old kernel count as 'not installed' :)
15:15        cantabile | *kernels
15:15          tcleval | cantabile:  Yes I just saw it
15:15       xdarklight | tcleval: ok, the less stuff you need to install the better :)
15:16          tcleval | cantabile: the problem was my interpretation of 'not installed'
15:16          tcleval | thx anyway xdarklight
15:16       xdarklight | if you want to keep (for example) 2 or 3 versions of the packages you probably need to use the python script from the wiki ;)
15:16       xdarklight | you're welcome :)
15:16          tcleval | xdarklight yeah probably
15:17          tcleval | xdarklight: anyway I added it to my favorites :-)

15:28         NewWorld | sahilm:  Try starting it from a terminal and see if there's any message when it crashes
15:28           sahilm | NewWorld: Already did that. No messages. The crashes are very rare though.
15:29           wonder | sahilm, using firefox from repo ?
15:29           sahilm | yes.

15:29         NewWorld | If it's very rare I wouldn't bother fixing it :S Unless you notice that it happens in the same circumstances again and again
15:29           sahilm | using a couple of standard addons.
15:30           sahilm | Yeah but sometimes I'm working on something important :)
15:30           sahilm | NewWorld: I'm yet to notice a pattern.

15:32         Aut0ExeC | everything good here?
15:32   DefunctProcess | No we desperately need your help
15:32         Aut0ExeC | ok ok
15:32         Aut0ExeC | whats up?
15:32           sahilm | What's the best way to maintain multiple versions of something? For example I want ruby1.9.1 and ruby1.8.7 to coexist. I don't want to get into a symlink mess.
15:32         Aut0ExeC | what can i help u with
15:32         Aut0ExeC | ?
15:32         * DefunctProcess rolls eyes
15:32         Aut0ExeC | lulz
15:34           sahilm | Must symlink?
15:34   DefunctProcess | sahilm: yea me thinks symlinks would be best way
15:34           sahilm | What happens when I forget about them and things break :)
15:35   DefunctProcess | sahilm: hmmm, write yourself an alias with some echo's to remind you when u run pacman
15:36           sahilm | DefunctProcess: Seems like a viable solution. Thanks.
15:37           sahilm | Using Archlinux in a production environment can be painful. How do you guys manage?
15:37           sahilm | Production is always lagging behind the upstream and Arch is constantly following it.
15:38          kelnoky | sahilm: not doing stupid things helps
15:38   DefunctProcess | sahilm: i would advise your to carefully and very selectively clean your package cache, also update often
15:38   DefunctProcess | also, vm's
15:38           sahilm | DefunctProcess: Virtual machines with other "stable" distributions as guests?
15:38   DefunctProcess | sahilm: negative
15:39           sahilm | DefunctProcess: Arch guests?
15:39   DefunctProcess | sahilm: you can run arch vms and keep two images of the same machine, one upgrade and breaks you run the other image and try to fix the broken one
15:40         Aut0ExeC | DefunctProcess: good idea bro
15:40         Aut0ExeC | DefunctProcess: u gat ur linux+ cert/
15:40         Aut0ExeC | ?/
15:40   DefunctProcess | no
15:40         Aut0ExeC | ok ok
15:40           sahilm | DefunctProcess: I understand what you're trying to say but it doesn't answer my original question. I'll try to explain the scenario.
15:40         Aut0ExeC | how do you know all this stuff man
15:40         Aut0ExeC | ?
15:40   DefunctProcess | common sense mr troll

15:41   Liquid-Silence | hmm gui?

15:42   Liquid-Silence | I know its curses based I want something gtk
15:42   Liquid-Silence | yeah not a big fan :P
15:42   DefunctProcess | transmission
15:42         Aut0ExeC | dude u said minimal
15:42   Liquid-Silence | deludge?
15:42         Aut0ExeC | after rtorrent is non minimal
15:42         Aut0ExeC | nah deluge is heavy
15:42         muunleit | !rulez
15:42           sahilm | Liquid-Silence: I have had problems with deluge.
15:42           sahilm | Liquid-Silence: It's starts eating the CPU.
15:43         Aut0ExeC | yeah
15:43         Aut0ExeC | had the prob too
15:43         Aut0ExeC | stay away from deluge
15:43         Aut0ExeC | ncurses is always the best way to go
15:43   DefunctProcess | transmission.
15:43        cantabile | deluge works fine for me
15:43   DefunctProcess | if gtk is must
15:43        cantabile | and you don't need to run the gui all the time - it's client/server
15:43   DefunctProcess | personally i dont kno why u need a gui for a torrent client
15:44         Aut0ExeC | exactly
15:44         Aut0ExeC | rtorrent is so nice
15:44   Liquid-Silence | lol the top part of my openbox menu is gone :(
15:44         Aut0ExeC | Liquid-Silence: quick fix = use tiling wm (musca wm)
15:44         oitnelis | Does anyone using ranger know how to paste something from the clipboard when issuing the ! command?
15:45   Liquid-Silence | Aut0ExeC: I am happy with openbox thanks :)
15:45         Aut0ExeC | k
15:45   DefunctProcess | OB is Z best
15:45         Aut0ExeC | hmmmmm
15:45         Aut0ExeC | ok
15:45         Aut0ExeC | i tried fluxbox once
15:47   DefunctProcess | flux != OB
15:47             grte | Fluxbox would be fine if openbox didn't exist.
15:47             grte | No, flux and openbox are not the same.
15:47             grte | But they are still both meant for the light desktop niche.
15:47         Aut0ExeC | i know they arent the same
15:47             grte | And openbox fills it better.
15:48         Aut0ExeC | i use tiling wm's
15:48             grte | Not as good as dwm, mind you.
15:48         Aut0ExeC | musca ftw
15:48             rson | joyfulgirl: i am for a moment, what's up?
15:48         oitnelis | I have a personal preference, it makes me special.
15:49             grte | That I'm special makes my personal preference special.
15:49         *       oitnelis rubs his mentalis
15:49         oitnelis | No.
15:49             grte | Yes.
15:49  DefunctProcess | i think the consensus is xmonad for tiling in here
15:49  DefunctProcess | !war
15:49           phrik | take it to #archlinux-war
15:50  DefunctProcess | lols
15:50        oitnelis | Your supposition that you're special is fallacious.

15:50        oitnelis | Ahh, I see.
15:50  DefunctProcess | hahaha

15:52       cantabile | How can I convert a 6.1 dts file into something stereo? mp3, flac, aac, whatever
15:52        Aut0ExeC | ok
15:52        oitnelis | I asked for help.
15:52            grte | I missed it.
15:52  DefunctProcess | Ok back to the fun land of contract law.
15:52        Aut0ExeC | cantabile: dts?
15:52       cantabile | yes, dts
15:52        Aut0ExeC | hmm u try mencoder?
15:52        oitnelis | It was about ranger file manager, hardly anyone uses it though so it fell on deaf ears.
15:52            grte | cantabile: ffmpeg can most likely do it.
15:53        Aut0ExeC | yeah mcoder of ffmpeg
15:53        Aut0ExeC | *mencoder
15:53       cantabile | I'm hoping someone might know the exact command, so I don't have to read the manpage :D

15:54       cantabile | :)

15:54        Aut0ExeC | yup
15:54        Aut0ExeC | if ur using menconder it wont work.. but if ur using mencoder.. it probably will
15:55        Aut0ExeC | just a tip

15:59        fogobogo |     The Extended Module Player is a portable command-line module player and a plugin for Audacious. Plays over 70 mainstream and exotic module formats
15:59        Aut0ExeC | screen -R is for reattaching dude
15:59        fogobogo | audacious is optional
15:59  Liquid-Silence | csc`: anything else I can try?
15:59        poseidon | twoface: I usually cleanly detach.  Is there a way I can set it up to detach incase I get disconncted (which happens a lot)
15:59            csc` | VMWare
15:59        fogobogo | csc`: ^
15:59            csc` | fogobogo, 1. this laptop doesn't run arch, my desktop does
15:59  Liquid-Silence | csc`: better? :P
15:59    fallenwizard | poseidon: I can detach and it still works
15:59         twoface | poseidon, i don't know - i have switched to tmux, it handles it a lot better
16:00        fogobogo | csc`: ok. still its code
16:00            csc` | fogobogo, and 2. im in an internet cafe with no headphones

16:09             csc` | Usually package upgrades, Infin1ty
16:09         Infin1ty | i upgraded today my netbook after 1 and an half month without an upgrade, went smooth, later i upgraded this laptop (i use it daily to my work) after 2 weeks with no updates, no problems
16:09         Infin1ty | it's still up to the user not reading enough
16:09         Infin1ty | i never had any upgrade issues with arch
16:10         Aut0ExeC | Infin1ty: thats cuz u prolly dont have that many packages installed
16:10             csc` | Infin1ty, It doesn't have to be any predetermined time length
16:10        Infin1ty | I do have

16:10            csc` | Packages can work fine one day and break the next

16:10        Infin1ty | they break for a reason
16:10        Infin1ty | and you can always get the PKGBUILD and fix it yourself
16:11            csc` | Or you could just regenerate the configuration and it'll work
16:11            scp1 | muunleit, I agree with most, except for the 'But never, ever, assume people are there just to annoy you. ' part
16:11            csc` | Aut0ExeC, rebuild the package then
16:11        Infin1ty | if something breaks on arch, it much more easily fixable than other distros
16:11        Infin1ty | as far as i see it.
16:11        Aut0ExeC | csc`: i downgraded sdl
16:11        Aut0ExeC | had already cleared cache :(
16:12            csc` | thats rather stupid, all you had to do was recompile Wesnoth

16:13         Stythys | that too
16:13        fogobogo | also nice
16:13        Infin1ty | csc`, i had my time with ubuntu, i tried to setup my TPM chip to work, had to patch the kernel etc.. it was a nightmare!
16:13        Infin1ty | csc`, i moved to arch, it was so simple.
16:13            csc` | and this poor laptop has survived quite a few LTS updates
16:13        fogobogo | Infin1ty: what exactely can the tpm chip do?
16:13            csc` | Infin1ty, i used arch as a desktop platform and ubuntu as a more stable LT solution for my laptop
16:13        Infin1ty | fogobogo, ecrypt stuff, store certificates etc.., act as a pkcs#11
16:14        fogobogo | and what is a pkcs#11?
16:14        fogobogo | hmm
16:14            csc` | my archlinux install is long since died due to hardware failure, the drive is still accessable and i eventually plan on transferring all the data over to a new drive
16:14        Infin1ty | fogobogo, it can act as a smartcard device
16:14        fogobogo | oh nice
16:14        Infin1ty | fogobogo, i can store/share certificates
16:14        fogobogo | hmm
16:14        Infin1ty | fogobogo, i can tell for example firefox to use the tpm chip to store my passwords
16:14        Infin1ty | fogobogo, it's a different memory share than the system.
16:14        fogobogo | Infin1ty: any chance youll put that up into the wiki or os?
16:15        Infin1ty | fogobogo, i will when i'll have time ;) i will write  a wiki on it
16:15        Aut0ExeC | well it was nice chatting with u guys
16:15        Aut0ExeC | i've got to run
16:15        Aut0ExeC | csc`: see u around buddy
16:15        Infin1ty | fogobogo, you can even ecrypt the whole system with the tpm, if someone steals your hardisk he can't open it unless he has the same hardware as you have
16:15         *          csc` gives Aut0ExeC a swift kick in the arse
16:15        fogobogo | Infin1ty: thats be damn nice. thanks.
16:15        Aut0ExeC | wtf
16:15         Stythys | :D
16:15        Aut0ExeC | csc`: why?
16:15        Aut0ExeC | i tried to leave on a good note
16:15        Aut0ExeC | but not u
16:16        fogobogo | hmm
16:16         Stythys | oh he's just helpin' you out the door
16:16         Stythys | go on now =]
16:16        Infin1ty | people still don't understand the power behind this small TPM chip :) even ecryptfs support it now
16:16      Wunderkind | hola  /o/
16:16        Aut0ExeC | k k
16:16            csc` | People don't understand that I hate humanity, do they =(
16:16            tigr | i understand
16:16        Infin1ty | Lenovo uses the TPM chip with their Password Manager (for Windows) in order to store the passwords there
16:16        Aut0ExeC | csc`: u hate urself?
16:17            csc` | I hate you too
16:17        Aut0ExeC | wow
16:17        Aut0ExeC | u are evil dude
16:17        Aut0ExeC | really
16:17        fogobogo | Infin1ty: yeah. you see, it aint easy to find out a whole lot about it or its use when every blog is raving "i gotz me ubundu 10!!!11zomg!"
16:17            csc` | !praise csc`
16:17      Wunderkind | i love you all
16:17         *         phrik gives csc` a fierce cuddling
16:17         *          csc` shudders
16:17         bioe007 | anyone know where to get 'Net/SMTP/SSL.pm' ?
16:17             gog | cosecant prime?
16:17        Aut0ExeC | csc`: i think u need more hugs
16:17        Aut0ExeC | csc`: more love
16:17         *    Wunderkind hugs #archlinux
16:17            csc` | I think you need a dictionary
16:17              nn | bioe007: cpan
16:17         *      Aut0ExeC hugs csc`

16:18        Infin1ty | fogobogo, and then you see those guys making an upgrade, the upgrade breaks in the middle and then, no system ;)

16:18        Aut0ExeC | see u guys
16:18        Aut0ExeC | i'm outee
16:18        Infin1ty | fogobogo, most of the forums are loaded with those kind of questions right now, heh, people breaks in the middle of an upgrade, their system is unusable.
16:18         bioe007 | nn: try to avoid cpan unless there is nothng in aur/extra
16:19              nn | pacpan<3
16:19        fogobogo | Infin1ty: really? gotta have a look. wonder if the db is screwed
16:19              nn | i generally try to avoid perl at all costs on my machine at all
16:19         bioe007 | git send-emil seems to wqant this
16:19              nn | perl php and other 'unclean' things
16:20        Infin1ty | fogobogo, i've seen at least 3 questions today in one of the forums i look on (one of them is in hebrew) and people got their internet connection shutdown in the middle of the upgrade, they come later to upgrade and couldn't do anything, one of them reinstalled his system
16:20    sledgehammer | bioe007, pkgfile doesn't need the full path
16:20            csc` | Database corruption has been around since I started using Arch
16:20        fogobogo | haha. so much for that
16:20            csc` | which is roughly 3 years
16:21        fogobogo | csc`: yeah. but its really nasty if you loose the pkg db and want to keep your system
16:21            csc` | indeed
16:21            csc` | and it hasn't been fixed
16:22            csc` | Thats another reason I can't afford to use Arch on this laptop like everyone tries forcing me into
16:22            csc` | No more optical drive
16:22              nn | Thumbdrive.

16:22           phrik | fogobogo: No matches found.
16:22         MJEvans | I had a total **** of a time installing arch from chroot

16:22           phrik | fogobogo: Install Arch from network (via PXE) - ArchWiki: <http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Install_Arch_from_network_(via_PXE)>
16:22        fogobogo | csc`: ^ :D
16:22        Infin1ty | csc`, i installed my arch from usb
16:22            csc` | and I don't have adequate network stability for that
16:22           Sagan | MJEvans: is that good or bad?
16:23        fogobogo | csc`: that would only be an issue if you upgrade ubuntu
16:23         MJEvans | Sagan: Very bad actually.  Ever other dist I've used in the last 10 years has been able to install from within an existing linux dist; including live CDs via chroot or other methods.
16:23           Sagan | MJEvans: I tried it from gentoo distro, it didn't work so well. Failed at kernel boot.
16:24     velcroshooz | arch does that fine - the install in on was off some random ubuntnu livecd i have lying around asi didnt have a burner
16:24        fogobogo | there is a pacman.static afaik
16:24            csc` | fogobogo, i steal peoples innernets to upgrade my laptop when the time comes
16:24         MJEvans | Sagan: Usually it's something along the lines of, download a tarball, extract in to the mounted area, chroot /mount/whatever /bin/sh and away you go with doing that.
16:24            csc` | Its not broken so im not going to 'fix' it with arch
16:24            csc` | which will, inevitably, break it
16:24     velcroshooz | fogobogo, static is no more - it takes like 5 packages to get pacman running on ubuntu anyway
16:24            csc` | =P
16:24         MJEvans | debian based things have that other thing... debootstrap or something
16:24         MJEvans | Same/diff really
16:25        fogobogo | velcroshooz: thought its maintained by archlinux.fr now
16:25        Infin1ty | because i have 3 pcs in my house running archlinux, once daily at night i rsync a mirror to my place, it's nice, i can upgrade my 3 pcs in a few minutes :)
16:25     velcroshooz | fogobogo, its no longer on thier site, hasnt been for awhile
16:25            csc` | I have two running debian, including the laptop, one running windows, and a drive on ice with archlinux on it
16:25            csc` | oh, and a SPARC
16:26    sledgehammer | Infin1ty, there are smarter ways of doing that - or do you have every Arch package installed? :)
16:26        Infin1ty | sledgehammer, i always keep the whole mirror synced in case i will want to install other things, i know what you mean :)
16:26        fogobogo | velcroshooz: ah ok. didnt know that. knew though that the official static support is long gone
16:26        Infin1ty | Slashbunny, i could create a smarter script to sync only what i have
16:26           intgr | Infin1ty: Sounds like all you need is a simple HTTP proxy.
16:26     velcroshooz | MJEvans, this is all possbile with arch too - once you get pacman running on ubuntu its literally 4 or 5 commands for an install.
16:26        Infin1ty | intgr, but not all of them have the same packages
16:27           intgr | Yeah, so they go through this single caching proxy.
16:27        Infin1ty | well, only the first synced took a few hours, every night in about 30 mins i finish to sync
16:27         MJEvans | velcroshooz: Right, but I didn't want to alter the host OS.  I was literally using another system and a drive attached via a USB adapter
16:27           intgr | You're contributing to the global electron shortage :)
16:28        Infin1ty | lol:)
16:30        Infin1ty | well i'm off to bed, night :)
16:31            tigr | g'night
16:31     velcroshooz | MJEvans, ill agree with that, gets messy getting pacman to run without getting the host dirty - i used a livecd lying around like i said, so that wasnt an issue.
16:32     velcroshooz | the wiki needs refreshing too in the installation from another distro section - i was trying to get around to adding my two cents on how i got it to work
16:32            tigr | that would be great
16:33     velcroshooz | all the pacman static stuff should be pulled out at the very least, as its no longer around
16:34            tigr | i've tried to get it to compile, but i haven't been able to
16:35        fogobogo | Infin1ty: o/

17:10     likewhoa211 | Can someone help me disable 'tap-to-click" Ive read trough some forum but nothing has worked
17:11        fogobogo | fengshaun: could you try again with mplayer -msglevel all=6 and paste that output?
17:11     likewhoa211 | In the past on other laptops ive been able to disable it in xorg.conf file
17:12            csc` | !lart Liquid-Silence

17:12            nawi | it blinks randomly, my irc-friend found it
17:12       fengshaun | fogobogo: sure
17:12        fogobogo | fengshaun: btw. does the file play just fine?
17:12        fogobogo | like. normally
17:13  Liquid-Silence | too many nicks with F
17:13       fengshaun | fogobogo: this works: mplayer -ao pcm infile.mp4 -ao pcm:file="outfile.wav"
17:13    sledgehammer | likewhoa211, check the synaptics and xorg pages in the wiki
17:13       fengshaun | fogobogo: yea, the file plays fine
17:14        fogobogo | fengshaun: thats great. you still paste the output? i really like to know what codec the audio is in
17:14       malnilion | Liquid-Silence, I agree.
17:15       fengshaun | fogobogo: yup, I'm pasting it now
17:15        fogobogo | thanks
17:15    somnambulant | it's OK to use sudo to upgrade right.. or should always su to root first?
17:15            tigr@| somnambulant, sudo is fine
17:15     likewhoa211 | sledgehammer, Yeah I read a lil of that. My touch pad is not a synaptics device though

17:16        fogobogo | fengshaun: thanks
17:16     likewhoa211 | sledgehammer, Ill try the synaptics driver anyhow, i guess
17:16    somnambulant | tigr: OK thx - I used to just be root, but I changed to sudo when I started using clyde, because it handles aur
17:16        fogobogo | fengshaun: ahhhh its wave
17:16       fengshaun | fogobogo: what?
17:17         Borgasm | tsunami?
17:17        fogobogo | fengshaun: the audio in the container is lossless. so you can happily encode it to w/e you want without too much loss
17:17       fengshaun | fogobogo: that's good news :)
17:17        fogobogo | fengshaun: also, that partly explains why dumpaudio didnt work
17:17       fengshaun | why?
17:18       fengshaun | fogobogo: so how can I convert it now?  The way that works now is kind of crappy since it plays the video on high speed.
17:18    sledgehammer | likewhoa211, what driver did you use before?
17:19        fogobogo | fengshaun: handbrake would probably the easiest way. else ffmpeg or mencoder
17:19       fengshaun | ohhh, I don't know any of those
17:19     likewhoa211 | sledgehammer, Synaptics however this is a new laptop
17:20        fogobogo | fengshaun: imho. try ffmpeg
17:20         -!- Craig_Dem_ is now known as Craig_Dem

00:11         tigrmesh | heh.  alias fail
00:11           jonnor | timofonic: you do know that core gstreamer has only two deps, libxml and glib?
00:12        timofonic | jonnor: A bunch of insane modules for every crap, plugins everywhere. Those plugins has too many dependencies, it's attached to all the gnome bag of shit
00:12        timofonic | jonnor: And what use has it?
00:12           jonnor | timofonic: you can swap out the plugins if you'd like :)
00:12        timofonic | jonnor: Core gstreamer means unuseful crap
00:12       falconindy | the core gstreamer is worthless without the plugins
00:12        timofonic | falconindy: Indeed
00:13           jonnor | timofonic: what use what has?
00:13        timofonic | jonnor: Most of the times gstreamer is just another retarded layer. I'm sure it can be useful to make unskilled coders happy, but I don't care...
00:13        timofonic | jonnor: Uh?
00:14       falconindy | look at gstreamer0.10-base
00:14        timofonic | jonnor: What use has gstreamer? A common API? :D
00:14       falconindy | for starters, that is
00:14           jonnor | timofonic: yes, thats what the core provides, more or less
00:14           jonnor | and a plugin system
00:14        timofonic | jonnor: For what?
00:14        rabbitear | I always like how they package them, the good, the bad, and the ugly
00:15       falconindy | jonnor: that was kind of the point... a counter to the argument that it only has two deps.
00:15        timofonic | jonnor: For adding support? It's just modulation bloating it seems
00:15       falconindy | it doesnt do anything except provide an API for imminent bloat
00:15        timofonic | jonnor: "See?, it's lightweight" But you need to add zillions of plugins/modules to make it usable
00:15        timofonic | I avoid ALL software using gstreamer, same as Python and Qt
00:16           jonnor | timofonic: so that applications can target a single, stable API and ABI. Instead of having to code yourself against each of the libraries that provides a certain codec or other functionality
00:16        timofonic | I would avoid GTK, but it's too attached to many asses...
00:16           jonnor | or even worse, writing your own abstraction layer
00:16       nisstyre65 | timofonic; what do you have against python other than it's a bit slow sometimes?
00:16        timofonic | jonnor: Well, I think most c00l stuff could be provided by ffmpeg itself. About other uses, proper different projects
00:17           jonnor | timofonic: that sounds like a good way to "bloat" ffmpeg?
00:17        timofonic | jonnor: And about stable APIs, those should be managed and taken into consideration by some sane organization (FreeDesktop seems like in need of proper organization, even more than Xorg, ALSA and SANE)
00:18        timofonic | nisstyre65: That is more than slow sometimes :D
00:18       nisstyre65 | timofonic; is your computer ten years old? lol
00:18        timofonic | jonnor: Trying to do everything means crap
00:18       nisstyre65 | it's tradeoff for speed and ease of coding
00:18        timofonic | nisstyre65: Some are even older and proud of it ;)
00:19           jonnor | Actually, I want to spend my time on something more productive than this. Good night everybody.
00:19        timofonic | nisstyre65: Ease? I prefer get less retarded and write/use proper apps
00:19        timofonic | jonnor: Bye, have luck
00:19        timofonic | jonnor: ffmpeg bloating? Nah, just add proper AV stuff. Other stuff should go to different projects
00:20       nisstyre65 | timofonic; have you ever used python?
00:20        timofonic | falconindy: You did understand my irony on arch bbs :D
00:20        timofonic | falconindy: Also... what's wrong with PulseAudio and Avahi? :)
00:20        timofonic | nisstyre65: Yes, I suffered it
00:21        timofonic | nisstyre65: Also, Python devs often do glue technology and make their apps giant bloated shit
00:21        rabbitear | timofonic: nobody really understands irony in real life
00:21       nisstyre65 | then you would know you can write your own modules and use those instead of the ones already made
00:21        timofonic | rabbitear: I sometimes do :)
00:21        timofonic | nisstyre65: Maybe Parrot can solve some problems...
00:21        rabbitear | :)
00:22       falconindy | timofonic: avahi is bloat made for people who don't know any better. pulse is buggy as hell and unnecessary 90% of the time
00:22        timofonic | nisstyre65: That's not the main problem, but the main Phython ecosystem and the nature of that programming language itself
00:22        timofonic | falconindy: So what alternative would you suggest?
00:22       falconindy | i suggest that one would be fine without either
00:22        timofonic | nisstyre65: That's not the main problem, but the main Python ecosystem and the nature of that programming language itself
00:23        timofonic | falconindy: The point is the Zeroconf/Bonjour protocol, an Apple shit. Right?
00:23       falconindy | right
00:23       nisstyre65 | Bonjour is horrible
00:23        timofonic | falconindy: UPnP clone?
00:23       falconindy | in small networks, you know exactly what your network nodes are
00:23       falconindy | in larger networks, you have dhcp/dns servers
00:23        timofonic | falconindy: Really, it's a glorified UPnP?
00:23       falconindy | yah, it is
00:24       nisstyre65 | someone wrote an android app for remotely controlling songbird that required bonjour even if you have linux or windows
00:24        timofonic | falconindy: yuck, the idea is so horrible I was unable to accept it
00:24       nisstyre65 | and it didn't let you just enter your ip
00:24       nisstyre65 | you had to use bonjour /facepalm
00:24        timofonic | nisstyre65: Songbird is now windows-only
00:24       nisstyre65 | sort of
00:24       falconindy | uggh, songbird...
00:24       nisstyre65 | not developed for linux anymore
00:24       falconindy | that's just what i want. javascript in my music player
00:24       nisstyre65 | but still maintaned
00:24        timofonic | nisstyre65: Practically, also quite bloated
00:24       nisstyre65 | I use foobar2000, even on linux
00:24        timofonic | nisstyre65: It's a XUL app...
00:24       falconindy | the linux side of songbird was forked
00:24         lstarnes | it is not officially supported on linux
00:25       nisstyre65 | foobar is the only music player that never hangs for me
00:25       falconindy | mpd + ncmpcpp
00:25       nisstyre65 | banshee is also quite slow
00:25        timofonic | falconindy: So Avahi - Rygel are same crap but different protocols, right?
00:26       falconindy | ive not heard of Rygel
00:26        rabbitear | me and my buddy are writing an ipad music thing...
00:26        rabbitear | I'm just doing the art
00:26        timofonic | falconindy: Another UPnP implementation, this time Gnome centric
00:26       nisstyre65 | foobar has an awesome http server plugin that you can use to remotely control your player
00:27        timofonic | rabbitear: ipad?
00:27        timofonic | rabbitear: iCrap?
00:27        rabbitear | he bought it not me
00:27       nisstyre65 | you should port android os to the ipad
00:27       falconindy | timofonic: i can only assume its junk... uPnP has been the cause for countless hacks on shitty routers
00:27        timofonic | falconindy: indeed
00:27        rabbitear | he codes tho...
00:27        rabbitear | thats whats cool about him, he doesn't drink lot too, I do!
00:28       nisstyre65 | I think the word bloated should trigger an automatic kline
00:29        timofonic | falconindy: Anyway... what protocol to use as media sharing? NFS and Smb are limited to showing files, MPD lacks proper integration with sending the media over network with the same controlling connection if required
00:29        timofonic | falconindy: Also... MPD is Music, not Media :P
00:29       falconindy | i use NFS with great success
00:29        rabbitear | nisstyre65: too common anymore
00:29       nisstyre65 | I'm sick of hearing it
00:29        timofonic | falconindy: What do you use for tagging?
00:29        rabbitear | lol
00:29       falconindy | timofonic: a proper torrent tracker ;P
00:30       falconindy | timofonic: short of that, easytag
00:30        timofonic | nisstyre65: bloated bloated bloated bloated bloated bloated bloated bloated bloated bloated bloated bloated bloated bloated bloated bloated bloated
00:30        rabbitear | too big to fail
00:31        rabbitear | they can even say that in tampon comericials for females anymore, becuase it will trun them off
00:32       falconindy | whew, that's a relief
00:32       falconindy | i was scared they'd start saying it in tampon commercials for guys
00:33        rabbitear | falconindy: I never seen one
00:33        rabbitear | falconindy: no flash..
00:33        timofonic | falconindy: Tampon commercials for guys? Too much anal sex by gay/bi people?

00:35       falconindy | Splex: uhhh, then you'll need to find the offset of each partition. good luck.

00:36            Splex | falconindy, is there a way to 'mount' the file into /dev as if it were a hdd?
00:36        rabbitear | just rebuild, if they break it, they will do nothing about it
00:36       falconindy | Splex: yes... like i said, you'll need to find the byte offset

00:53        timofonic | shoeunited: Amiga was interesting, but lacked proper memory protection. But also that made bad programs to go away easier
00:53       falconindy | timofonic: a linux power user won't design a GUI because they'd prefer the command line
00:53        timofonic | shoeunited: memory leaks meaned guru meditations and freezes :)
00:54       shoeunited | Point of fact, falconindy is right.  You cannot strip the command line away.
00:54        timofonic | falconindy: "catch 22"?

00:59        rabbitear | DigitalKiwi: how much crap goes down the craper every day?
00:59       falconindy | one of these days i'll actually bother to post about cower on the bbs
01:00         *    DigitalKiwi cd ~/media/programs/c && mv cower clurpy && cd clurpy && mv cower.c clurpy.c
01:00      DigitalKiwi | there done!
01:00       falconindy | woo, halfway there
01:00        rabbitear | DigitalKiwi: how many different smells go past this door, over one mouth?
01:00        rabbitear | falconindy: whats oou bbs?
01:00      DigitalKiwi | what ever happened to children should be seen and not heard
01:00      DigitalKiwi | cause rabbitear seriously needs to stfu
01:01        rabbitear | DigitalKiwi: f u
01:01       falconindy | rabbitear: oou like an elephant
01:01        rabbitear | DigitalKiwi: thanks
01:01        rabbitear | DigitalKiwi: just giving you ideas for you questions
01:01  mode/#archlinux [+o eir] by ChanServ
01:01        rabbitear | DigitalKiwi: you need them
01:01  mode/#archlinux [-qo shemale_magic!*@* eir] by eir
01:01      DigitalKiwi | why did shemale_magic just get unbanned
01:01      DigitalKiwi | considering it has been banned like 20 times
01:01       falconindy | eir is benevolent
01:02      DigitalKiwi | i think we would know by now it is not going to change its attitude
01:02        rabbitear | DigitalKiwi: you might even code up a webcam for where you live
01:02        rabbitear | DigitalKiwi: its crazy bro
01:02      DigitalKiwi | eir only does what the ops tell it/let it do
01:02        rabbitear | DigitalKiwi: about 7-8 webcams too
01:02       falconindy | i thought eir was controlled by freenode staff
01:03       falconindy | !give rabbitear ops
01:03            phrik | rabbitear: ops notified to kick falconindy
01:03       falconindy | doh
01:03       falconindy | lol, that didn't quite work out the way i thought it would
01:03        timofonic | falconindy: I emailed Lennart, hahaha
01:03        rabbitear | I don't comment
01:03      DigitalKiwi | falconindy: it is a freenode made/run bot but the ops here control it
01:03       falconindy | fair enough
01:03      DigitalKiwi | !pingops
01:03            phrik | Caleb, glguy, wizzo, callan, tomkx, cactus, tigrmesh, Ghost1227, Mion, MrElendig, Xilon,
01:03        timofonic | falconindy: I also write the forum thread address, so you have and excuse to say how much his software sucks!
01:03      DigitalKiwi | i lawled
01:03      DigitalKiwi | anyway
01:04        timofonic | falconindy: He's gonna read it, even if not replied me
01:04        timofonic | DigitalKiwi: Hello :D
01:04      DigitalKiwi | when an op bans someone eir messages them to ask what they want to do
01:04       falconindy | timofonic: all you, bro
01:04        timofonic | DigitalKiwi: What do you think of systemd?
01:04      DigitalKiwi | they can then set a time limit on the ban
01:04        rabbitear | there's always somebody that has a bigger mouth, and says who should be around and who shouldn't
01:05      DigitalKiwi | 5 shots in half an hour should get me pretty far along methinks
01:05      DigitalKiwi | of rum
01:05      DigitalKiwi | captain morgan
01:05        rabbitear | we've been studying that for years and years
01:05      DigitalKiwi | timofonic: no idea

01:05            phrik | Title: Arch Linux Forums / systemd: Yet Another Init Replacement (at bbs.archlinux.org)
01:05        rabbitear | so you can relax too
01:05        rabbitear | if you wanna
01:05        rabbitear | basicly we already have all the data together
01:05       shoeunited | Ballmer effect.
01:06        timofonic | DigitalKiwi: Vala and libgee as build time dependencies makes it a very sexy Init replacement ;)
01:06        rabbitear | ya
01:06        rabbitear | damn right too
01:06      DigitalKiwi | shoeunited: indeed
01:07       falconindy | DigitalKiwi: 5 shots of rum gets you halfway up Ballmer Peak
01:07       falconindy | unfortunately, the ascent is logarthmic
01:07        rabbitear | I won't go
01:07       falconindy | another 5 shots only gets you to 3/4's of the way up
01:08      DigitalKiwi | :(
01:08        rabbitear | not to that party
01:08      DigitalKiwi | so i need like 15 shots?
01:08        rabbitear | I got like a few friends
01:08      DigitalKiwi | i'm not sure i'm willing to use that much rum considering it is already after midnight
01:08        rabbitear | no reason to lose them buddy
01:08         *    DigitalKiwi should start drinking earlier
01:08       falconindy | 15 won't get you there... you might see the top at that point though
01:08        rabbitear | sorry about your lossss
01:08        rabbitear | if you ever try and call me
01:08        rabbitear | brb.
01:08      DigitalKiwi | please don't
01:09        timofonic | DigitalKiwi: clurpy? :P
01:10       falconindy | Kiwi decided it would be an awesome idea to fork my AUR agent... about 2 weeks before i finished it
01:10       shoeunited | timofonic: It's the big secret, he's just hacking slurpy into clyde.
01:10         *     shoeunited barrel rolls.
01:11       falconindy | use cower, be done with it
01:11        timofonic | shoeunited: But he uses Lua...
01:11       falconindy | "trust us, its the best!"
01:11       shoeunited | timofonic: I was being stupid on purpose.
01:11       shoeunited | I <3 clyde 4 all time. ;D
01:11        timofonic | DigitalKiwi made me to being into his sect, I can't quit now :(
01:11        rabbitear | DigitalKiwi: fud me only please, you don't believe in anything
01:12        timofonic | shoeunited: Oh, really? I did think you were plainly stupid! ;)
01:13       shoeunited | timofonic: Work on the English a little better to troll better.
01:13         *     shoeunited advancing in troll technology. :D
01:13        timofonic | falconindy: You are a WoW player, that explains all...
01:14        timofonic | shoeunited: Yes, you are right. At least I managed to be able to use another language than my native one (Spanish). I also know a bit of french and understand portuguese too :)
01:14       falconindy | timofonic: EX-wow player
01:14        nshepperd | gah, things are borking all over
01:15       falconindy | timofonic: please, ive amended my evil ways
01:15       shoeunited | I know I'm right. Now take it to Offtopic. ;D
01:15        timofonic | falconindy: So you recovered, that shit makes sequels...
01:15       falconindy | it doesn't when you switch to linux and develop a loathing for wine
01:15        timofonic | falconindy: Are you still fatty and unable to get social?
01:15        timofonic | falconindy: loathing?
01:15        timofonic | falconindy: wine?
01:16       falconindy | buggy
01:16        timofonic | falconindy: You are drunk!
01:16         -!- Brunito is now known as Brunacho
01:16       falconindy | nah, only tipsy
01:16        timofonic | falconindy: That's what alcoholics always say...
01:17       falconindy | and alcoholic is someone who has a problem
01:17       falconindy | im quite fine =P
01:17        rabbitear | I do disagree
01:17        rabbitear | you make that shit up in your head
01:18       falconindy | nah, the magical elves tell me
01:18        rabbitear | that this 'dude' the 'alcoholic' has a problem
01:18       falconindy | regardless, im out. take it easy
01:18       shoeunited | cya falconindy
01:18        rabbitear | but you have NO IDEA about the labels that you actually place
01:19        rabbitear | noooooo idea! at all
01:19        timofonic | falconindy: You are beyond any possible solution, all hopes are gone :(
01:19        rabbitear | nice talking to you falconindy
01:20        rabbitear | timofonic: me too, laters
01:20        timofonic | falconindy: At least you use Clyde, right?
01:20        timofonic | rabbitear: See you
01:20        timofonic | falconindy: You can be worse, you can be vegan like me :D
01:20        rabbitear | timofonic: I'll come back as a softists
01:20        rabbitear | only
01:21        timofonic | rabbitear: softwhat?

21:34          PavanKY | hi
21:34      DigitalKiwi | nou!
21:34         tigrmesh | hi
21:34     MutantTurkey | hey o/
21:34      DigitalKiwi | #haskell was in need of a rimshot
21:34          PavanKY | I just installed arch on a really old machine :), for some reason ethernet is always timed out
21:35      DigitalKiwi | and if i pm'd the bot i would have to move windows
21:35          PavanKY | how do i see if everything is being loaded properly
21:35      DigitalKiwi | which would mean i would forget who was where
21:35          PavanKY | p.s. really old ~ 5 years
21:35         tigrmesh | DigitalKiwi: we don't care
21:35      DigitalKiwi | and then you might message me and me not go to it cause i would think it was some nub who i don't want to talk to!
21:35      DigitalKiwi | and you would be mad!
21:35      DigitalKiwi | CAN'T YOU SEE?!
21:35      DigitalKiwi | I DID IT FOR YOU!
21:36      DigitalKiwi | IT WAS ALL FOR YOU!
21:36         tigrmesh | PM the bot anyway
21:36      DigitalKiwi | ALL OF IT
21:36          keenerd | PavanKY: That is not old.  Then had P4 back then.
21:37      DigitalKiwi | i has a PII with arch on it
21:37            R6Ale | hey guys, ive a permission (i think) problem with MPQ. I followed the wiki's instructions but ario won't build a DB. I didnt change permissions on /home/user/music since the wiki says not to :S
21:37      DigitalKiwi | now that's old
21:37          PavanKY | i know, i have a system back home which has p3 and 256mb on it :D
21:37            R6Ale | any ideas?
21:37          declan2 | Hey guys, sometimes my system will be really really slow, even though I don't really have many or any heavy apps running, and if I do top, it'll just say a few random things are taking up all the CPU
21:37          declan2 | What could cause that?
21:38          PavanKY | I'd hate to say your system seems to have the windows flu
21:38     MutantTurkey | what about instantbabycomeback.com
21:38           fryguy | "a few random things"
21:38     MutantTurkey | i have been thinking to register
21:38     MutantTurkey | "baby come back! you can blame it all one meee"
21:39          PavanKY | anyone help me out with ethernet ?
21:40           inaeth | PavanKY: Put the Cat-5 Cable into the ethernet port on the back of the computer. >:)
21:40          PavanKY | archwiki says to check for hwdetect  --show-net
21:40          PavanKY | inaeth, already did that before coming to irc :D
21:40     MutantTurkey | PavanKY: actually what inaeth said can help :)
21:41     MutantTurkey | PavanKY: any output?
21:41          PavanKY | no command hwdetect  :-|
21:42          PavanKY | while booting, the system is getting timed out at the network module
21:42          PavanKY | does that provide any insight ?
21:42          PavanKY | dont tell me i have a bad wire :-s
21:44     MutantTurkey | hwdetect is in the AUR
21:45          PavanKY | AUR doesnt come by defaukt does it :-/
21:45          PavanKY | default*
21:45           inaeth | PavanKY: Go to http://aur.archlinux.org, and search for it there.
21:45     MutantTurkey | actually its in the repos :)
21:45           inaeth | PavanKY: How to use the AUR is thoroughly documented in the Archlinux Wiki.
21:45         tigrmesh | !give PavanKY wiki aur
21:45            phrik | PavanKY: Arch User Repository - ArchWiki: <http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository>
21:46          PavanKY | thanks guys
21:46          PavanKY | fixed my problem :p
21:46           inaeth | PavanKY: rc.conf problem?
21:46          PavanKY | inaeth, you were not very far off :D, the damn system has two ethernet slots
21:46           inaeth | LOL
21:47          PavanKY | for something that old. wow. :)
21:47          PavanKY | any suggestions on a desktop environment ?
21:48           inaeth | PavanKY: Wow, I was guessing that some modules were out of order in the rc.conf file.
21:48          PavanKY | inaeth, arch has a great wiki :-) it is only few silly / freakish cases that are not handled there :D
21:48            rooob | How do you guys feel about an "all purpose" HTML site manager/editor? I'm installing Bluefish to try. I'll be taking care of a large conversion project, and maybe a small-medium size site.
21:49            rooob | PavanKY, XFCE or xmonad, depending on how much fun you want to have
21:49           inaeth | rooob: You mean, Vim with appropriate plugins is not an all purpose HTML editor for a site?
21:49         *         inaeth ducks and hides.
21:49            rooob | inaeth, I don't mean that at all. I want to look at the options though. Vim isn't the end all and beat all, necessarily.
21:50         *         inaeth gasps at the heresy.
21:50          PavanKY | rooob, I want to mostly use this system for storage / home server purposes (and may be some gui apps)
21:50          PavanKY | so less is more :), was thinking lxde, anyone with pros and cons ?
21:51          declan2 | fryguy: Yes, essentially random things. Python, xorg, nautilus
21:51          declan2 | metacity
21:51            rooob | PavanKY, fluxbox is lighter than xfce, and easier to start with than xmonad.
21:52          PavanKY | hmm ok
21:52     MutantTurkey | PavanKY: gnome :)
21:52         *          rooob snaps a rubber band at MutantTurkey 
21:52     MutantTurkey | for a nice DE
21:52          PavanKY | mutantturkey, i have gnome and kde on my laptop want to try something new (And small) with this one
21:53     MutantTurkey | nothing is wrong with gnome! i know all the tilers in here dislike it, but frankly it is nice to use.
21:53     MutantTurkey | PavanKY: a light gnome is XFCE, other than that, there are alot of good window managers, i'd say get started with flux, or openbox which are both really nice. if you are into tiling try out xmoand
21:53           inaeth | PavanKY: I'd have to put in a vote for Fluxbox. It's really a nice WM, and very lightweight.
21:53     MutantTurkey | or scrotwm
21:53        reventon_ | testing
21:54          PavanKY | wow. 3 votes for fluxbox. fluxbox it is then :D
21:54        reventon_ | can anyone hear me
21:54        reventon_ | or see me, rather
21:54           pronto | i vote for awesome \o/
21:54           inaeth | reventon_: Yup.
21:54          PavanKY | reventon_, we see you. sadly cant hear you
21:54         leprosys | +1 for awesome
21:54        KittyKatt | What xf86-video package should I use for an ATI Rage card? D:
21:55        reventon_ | interesting, irc is the only internet based app on my comp that is still work
21:55        reventon_ | ing
21:55            rooob | PavanKY, it's not always that simple, I would rather have awesome than fluxbox, although I'm too lazy to change atm
21:55          PavanKY | :))
21:55            rooob | you'd be happy with *box, whatever
21:55           inaeth | PavanKY: Of course, to get the most out of Awesome, you have to learn Lua.
21:55        reventon_ | i can't ping google, i can't load webpages, or download torrents, but i can chat on irc
21:55        reventon_ | amazing
21:55            rooob | It's just a fricken sever. Ticket closed

21:56        KittyKatt | ....I asked. >.>
21:56     MutantTurkey | ^_^
21:56        KittyKatt | <KittyKatt> What xf86-video package should I use for an ATI Rage card?

21:59        reventon_ | ok, i can't browse the web but i can talk to you guys. where should i look first for an error?
21:59        reventon_ | syslog is empty
21:59          PavanKY | reventon_, the good ol reboot didnt work ?
21:59       falconindy | reventon_: is DNS working?
21:59        reventon_ | you're my only connection with the world, i don't want to reboot and lose you guys too
21:59     MutantTurkey | reventon_: i dunno that is sort of weird. sure its DNS
22:00        reventon_ | i can ping www.google.com so dns is working
22:00     MutantTurkey | so hmm
22:00        reventon_ | but i can't browse www.google.com...
22:00     MutantTurkey | but no connection.
22:00        reventon_ | and it happened very all of a sudden
22:00     MutantTurkey | might sound dumb but your router isn't messing with port forewarding or anything?
22:01        reventon_ | i was reading a website about reverse polish notation on hp calculators, went to search something in google, now i can't browse the internet and my torrents stopped downloading
22:02       falconindy | are other internet apps working?

22:04            phrik | to save time, reboot your computer in the background using reboot &

22:05          PavanKY | falconindy, that can be done :-o wow.
22:05       falconindy | PavanKY: uh, sure... it doesn't actually net you anything though
22:06          p3nguin | sledgehammer: Everything seems to be fine after making that change.  I was able to take care of everything and submit my package into AUR.  Thanks for the boost earlier.
22:06      DigitalKiwi | doesn't it not reboot when you do that?
22:06       falconindy | depends... if your sudo timestamp wore out and you do 'sudo reboot &' it's just going to hang in the background
22:07         evaryont | DigitalKiwi: it also depends
22:07         evaryont | DigitalKiwi: it works if you do it in an X11 terminal (urxvt) :P
22:15            yitz_ | So, I'd like to upload my very firstest PKGBUILD file to AUR, but I can't figure out which catagory it fits in
22:16      techno-geek | yitz_: what is it?
22:16      DigitalKiwi | well the obvious solution is to not upload it
22:16            yitz_ | pdb2txt - converts between the palmdoc and txt formats
22:16            yitz_ | system?

22:18     MutantTurkey | yitz_: system, editors?
22:18          keenerd | DigitalKiwi: Is that why Ghost does yours? ;-)
22:18      DigitalKiwi | keenerd: hehe
22:18            yitz_ | It's not an editor, is it? Don't editors have to have some sort of UI?
22:18      DigitalKiwi | Ghost1227: update curlpaste!
22:18            yitz_ | I don't think ed is an editor
22:19         -!- ArchGT is now known as abuelo
22:19     sledgehammer | yitz_, just pick something vaguely relevant - those categories are dumb anyway, official repos got rid of them ages ago
22:19        Ghost1227 | DigitalKiwi: what about it
22:19         -!- abuelo is now known as ArchGT
22:19      DigitalKiwi | i had to update the git tree cause codepad changed their response
22:19        Ghost1227 | gotcha
