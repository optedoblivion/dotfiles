14:40 @WootRoot| 14:38 < Skull_One> Has BD ever put a paid app from the market into one of  his ROMs and released it to the general public?
14:40 @WootRoot| lawl
14:40 +jeagoss| yes
14:40 +jeagoss| i downloaded old versions
14:41 @WootRoot| 14:39 < Azhrei> yes

14:41 @thedudeTM| so
14:41 @WootRoot| 14:39 < Azhrei> but to his defense, most others were too.
14:41 @WootRoot| 14:39 < Skull_One> Doesn't matter.
14:41 @thedudeTM| i read somewhere that the old versions were just bugless beast rips
14:41 @WootRoot| id believe it

14:42 @WootRoot| 14:40 < Skull_One> I can defend someone when they haven't broken the law.
14:42 @WootRoot| 14:40 < Skull_One> But as a professional developer. I have to walk on this.

14:44 @WootRoot| 14:42 < Azhrei> they handled the situation very poorly too
14:44 +jeagoss| ffs
14:44 +jeagoss| they didn't handle the situation.  their community just got pissed off about what happened
14:44 @kmobs| class is over
14:44 @WootRoot| whats funny is, if they hadn't deleted the post, it wouldnt of blown up

14:45 +jeagoss| who is this fucker.  I am going to douche him now
14:45 @WootRoot| 14:43 < Skull_One> Good day all. I won't be back.  The simple fact is, I  have to maintain a level of professionalism that isn't  found here or in the Android community.
14:46 @WootRoot| 14:44 < Skull_One> In my pay bracket, I have to be above board at all times.
14:46 +jeagoss| o0

17:21 @thedudeisdead| that works
17:22 @kmobs| ./win

11:56 @thedudeTM| but i borked it up
11:56 @thedudeTM| stupid i5 mobile
11:57         * optedoblivion has a series of bash scripts to perform arch install on dell studio xps 13
11:57 +optedoblivion| I've re-installed like 50 times
11:57 +optedoblivion| lol
11:57 @thedudeTM| hahahahah
11:57 +optedoblivion| it's all for different reasons
11:57 +optedoblivion| trying to get drivers working
11:57 +optedoblivion| on the hardware
11:57 +optedoblivion| when I got it
11:57 +optedoblivion| it was too new of hardware
11:57 @thedudeTM| yeup
11:58 +optedoblivion| but then as times progress, it slowly settled in
11:58 @thedudeTM| that's been my problem with this new laptop
11:58 +optedoblivion| I have the 9500m which is an SLI of 9400 and 9200
11:58 +optedoblivion| or some shit like that
11:58 +optedoblivion| for low power
11:58 +optedoblivion| and the nvidia drivers for 64 bit sucked balls
11:59 +optedoblivion| I can't get my internal bluetooth working
11:59 +optedoblivion| my wireless card is a bitch
11:59 +optedoblivion| I have to use the AUR
11:59 +optedoblivion| or grab the driver and compile it myself

12:22 @WootRoot| i havnt been on it lately
12:22 @WootRoot| like you
12:22 @WootRoot| same with explosm
12:22 @WootRoot| catching up on both
12:22 @kmobs| ah cool
12:22 @WootRoot| by a while, i mean the ballpit one is the last one i can actively remember
12:22 @WootRoot| lol
12:22 @WootRoot| so longer than you
12:22 @kmobs| everything xkcd says is relevant
12:22 @kmobs| always

12:23 @WootRoot| hoping i missed some good stuff
12:23 @WootRoot| im just tired of tathome going "oh look look look what we did right there, see it? see it right ther? you cant has"
12:24 @thedudeTM| WootRoot: trying being on the 'beta tester list' and still not getting love
12:24 @WootRoot| then they do nothing but tweet ramdon news articles inbetween each new prototype
12:24 @kmobs| indeed :(
12:24 @thedudeTM| "we want cyaongen to test it first"
12:24 @kmobs| I want loves
12:24 @thedudeTM| fuuuuuuuuu
12:24 @WootRoot| thedudeTM: id love to test it, but i doubt ill let it replace launcher2

12:25 @thedudeTM| i saw that
12:25 @thedudeTM| pretty cool
12:25 @thedudeTM| ok
12:25 @thedudeTM| i think this ver of arch is noobish enough to be benji-friendly
12:25 @WootRoot| eh
12:25 @kmobs| yeah I saw that too
12:25 @kmobs| I don't use a lockscreen though
12:25 @thedudeTM| me either
12:25 @WootRoot| ChrisSoyars: that doesnt seem as secure as the standard pattern lock
12:26 @ChrisSoyars| still seems pretty cool
12:26 @WootRoot| because it shows me that i can delete one file and be fine, when i f'd with kaylas pattern lock
12:26 @WootRoot| i borked 2 of the capacitive buttons unlocking that bitch
12:26 @thedudeTM| random patter = more secure than connecting dots
12:26 @ChrisSoyars| im gonna pull in the changes
12:26 @ChrisSoyars| and mess w/ it
12:26 @WootRoot| thedudeTM: adb shell rm -rf is less secure than tons-of-hax
12:26 @kmobs| WootRoot: that command wouldn't do anything ;)
12:27 @WootRoot| kmobs: you get the point
12:27 @WootRoot| adb remount
12:27 @WootRoot| adb shell rm /data/system/gesture.key
12:27 @WootRoot| adb shell reboot
12:27 @WootRoot| there
12:27 @WootRoot| phone is unlocked
12:27 @thedudeTM| well
12:27 @kmobs| pull an iphone and have it wipe your data if you screw up your lock thin 10 times in a row
12:27 @thedudeTM| that's what you get for having a shell enabled adb
12:27 @thedudeTM| err
12:27 @thedudeTM| root shell*
12:28 @thedudeTM| they don't call it insecure for nothing
12:28 @WootRoot| thedudeTM: regardless, its still harder to bypass the standard lock
12:28 @kmobs| WootRoot: you can't do that on an unrooted phone
12:28 @WootRoot| kmobs: you cant use that on a unrooted phone either
12:28 @WootRoot| ...
12:28 @thedudeTM| but WootRoot i can pwn a phone regardless with adb
12:28 @WootRoot| if you want to try it you must have CM 5.0.6 installed, then:
12:28 @thedudeTM| keylock or no
12:28 @WootRoot| thedudeTM: yes, but its harder with the standard pattern lock
12:29 @thedudeTM| adb shell wipe data
12:29 @thedudeTM| pqattern lock pwned
12:29 @thedudeTM| of course
12:29 @WootRoot| well i mean with keeping the data
12:29 @kmobs| WootRoot: if you have root access and physical access, anybody can rape that shit
12:29 @thedudeTM| so is everything else
12:29 @WootRoot| kmobs: i know, once again, its HARDER with the standard lock
12:29 @thedudeTM| um
12:29 @WootRoot| not saying the standard lock is secure, at all, its just MORE secure than that
12:29 @thedudeTM| adb shell reboot
12:29 @thedudeTM| phone unlocked
12:29 @WootRoot| huh?
12:29 @thedudeTM| the whole point is
12:30 @kmobs| I don't want his crap to interfere with the stock google stuff
12:30 @thedudeTM| with physical access
12:30 @kmobs| because what if you wanna get rid of it?
12:30 +cyanogen| he made the new style lock configurable
12:30 @thedudeTM| it doesn't matter how secure the lock is
12:30 +cyanogen| i'll probably merge it
12:30 @WootRoot| thedudeTM: i agree
12:30 +cyanogen| greasy fingers give away the pattern
12:31 @WootRoot| hahaha
12:31 @ChrisSoyars| i like the "new style lock"
12:31 @ChrisSoyars| iz about to build it
12:31 @WootRoot| caution: if you update your rom, or flash another mod that replaces framework.jar or android.framework.jar, and your lock pattern repeats nodes, you may not be able to log in upon reboot. either (1) make sure you disable your lock screen before flashing or (2) rm gesture.key as described in the faq!

11:39 @ChrisSoyars| i just was hoping to have a fullykanged gapps bundle
11:39 +cyanogen| so the n1 stuff is fine
11:40 @ChrisSoyars| instead of a hacked together one
11:40 +cyanogen| oh i'll make one :)
11:40 @ChrisSoyars| i has one
11:40 +cyanogen| aye
11:40 @ChrisSoyars| AYE

11:50  mode/#teamdouche [+v benbuchacher] by ChanServ
11:52 @ChrisSoyars| cyanogen: will need to do some hackery for sensors i believe
11:52 @ChrisSoyars| and possibly a prebuilt build.board.prop
11:52 @ChrisSoyars| at least, thats how i was doing it for openeclair
11:52 +benbuchacher| mornin guys
11:55 +cyanogen| yeah the build.xxx.prop stuff isn't there yet
11:56 +cyanogen| i'm not sure if the aosp sensors library has the trackball stuff for sapphire
11:56 @ChrisSoyars| i believe it does
11:56 +cyanogen| but i made it copy as sensors.msm7k.so so if so then it's fine
11:57 @ChrisSoyars| ah k
11:57 @ChrisSoyars| that would work, didnt think of that
11:57 +cyanogen| and kernel 2.6.33 works 100%
11:58 @ChrisSoyars| kickass
11:58 @ChrisSoyars| im about to buildz0r
11:59 +cyanogen| haven't put the working karanal and etc in the build yet

12:10 +benbuchacher| The purpose of Chef Central is to provide a learning environment for XDA users that truly want to learn the craft of ROM development. It is monitored and moderated by skilled developers that you know from our community. These developers are willing to generously give of their time to help teach the eager learners among you.
12:10 +benbuchacher| Please use this forum by posting questions. As with posting anywhere on XDA, please search before you post to make sure that your topic of question hasn't been covered in the past.

12:10 +cyanogen| i will start using industrial espionage techniques if necessary to get all drivers working
12:11 +benbuchacher| LOL
12:11 @ChrisSoyars| nice
12:11 @ChrisSoyars| im excited
12:11 @ChrisSoyars| im ready to give up openeclair
12:11 @ChrisSoyars| :D
12:11 +cyanogen| i don't wanna see OE go, i'm taking a different approach
12:11 +optedoblivion| he's gonna steal it
12:11 +optedoblivion| and take it to holland
12:11 @ChrisSoyars| noooooooooooo
12:11 @ChrisSoyars| openeclair = FAIL
12:11 +benbuchacher| lol
12:11 @ChrisSoyars| and im tired of supporting it :D
12:11 @ChrisSoyars| but wes isnt lol
12:11 @thedudeTM| hahaha
12:12 +prash| poor wes
12:12 +prash| he's doing all the work and makign spreadsheets and chris is here badmouthing it
12:12 @thedudeTM| if i had a g1 i'd support it
12:12 +benbuchacher| lol
12:12 @ChrisSoyars| lol
12:12 @ChrisSoyars| i still build it
12:12 @ChrisSoyars| and help him squash bugs here and there
12:12 +prash| whats the deal with all the spreadsheets anyway? is he a little A.D.D/obsessive?
12:12 @ChrisSoyars| the n1 is just too sex
12:12 @ChrisSoyars| probably
12:12 +prash| a little special
12:12         * optedoblivion notices benbuchacher only response the last several times was a form of "LOL"
12:12 +benbuchacher| HAHA*
12:12 @ChrisSoyars| he barely speaks english
12:13 @ChrisSoyars| damn foreigner
12:13 +optedoblivion| lol
12:13 +benbuchacher| I no understand
12:13 +cyanogen| he's putting a lot of effort into stuff like LWPs and whatnot
12:13 +cyanogen| i say fuck all of that
12:13 @ChrisSoyars| yeah
12:13 +cyanogen| it's a g1
12:13 @ChrisSoyars| i said fuck LWPs a while ago
12:13 @ChrisSoyars| and every time i remove them from the vendor setup
12:13 +cyanogen| they barely work on the droid
12:13 @ChrisSoyars| i get chewed out
12:13 +prash| yeah g1 shouldnt have lwps
12:13 @ChrisSoyars| but the users want them
12:13 @ChrisSoyars| so whatevs
12:13 +cyanogen| users are wrong
12:13 @ChrisSoyars| i need to fix launcher2 for mdpi
12:13 +prash| the endusers are bunch of dumbshits
12:13 +prash| look at droid
12:13 @ChrisSoyars| Launcher2 doesnt run bad with 3d working
12:14 +cyanogen| sticking with launcher1 :)
12:14 +prash| its like aol users on irc
12:14 +benbuchacher| users want everything all the time
12:14 +cyanogen| it's just the memory constraints are so painful
12:14 +prash| i guess you can just be like 'if you want lwp and all the goodies go get OE'
12:14 +cyanogen| i'm hoping that 2.6.33 smooths things out
12:14 +prash| this way wes doesn't commit suicide
12:15 +cyanogen| really the only reason i want eclair working is for the multiple sync stuff
12:15 @ChrisSoyars| the 3d hackery wes did was causing major memory issues on 2.6.29
12:15 +prash| yeah thats the one thing i missed the most from 4.9 the multiple accounts
12:15 +cyanogen| my wife wants it and i don't have $500 to get her a nexus right now
12:15 +prash| and maybe voice keyboard
12:15 @thedudeTM| ok time to test out this lock stuff
12:15 @ChrisSoyars| optedoblivion: come in here
12:15 +benbuchacher| haha
12:15 @ChrisSoyars| krzy just dreww a ripped version of me on the whiteboard in my office
12:15 @thedudeTM| optedoblivion: don't do it, he just farted
12:16 @ChrisSoyars| and is shooting nerf darts at it
12:16 @ChrisSoyars| its ridic
12:16 +prash| yeah that sounds like a total dutch oven set up
12:16 @ChrisSoyars| apparently u get 50 points if u shoot me in the dick
12:18 @thedudeTM| it's a tiny target, you should get 100
12:18 @ChrisSoyars| agreed
12:18 @ChrisSoyars| the target is pretty small
12:18 +prash| minute
12:19 @thedudeTM| i love grimm's disclaimer "First Off All: This ROM is not for Noobs.."
12:20 @thedudeTM| uhhh actually it IS for noobs, cause I don't need your help assembling all that stuff in one rom
12:26         -!- kmobsHAT is now known as kmobs
12:26 @kmobs| hi
12:26 +cyanogen| i'll put the cyanogen_msm_defconfig up there later
12:27 +cyanogen| i'm not sure how to make it build the wlan driver yet though as part of the kernel.mk stuff
12:28 @kmobs| wait you have proprietary drivers o.O
12:28 +cyanogen| i think the only thing that isn't going to be working is video encoding
12:28 @kmobs| nice.  I'll test out on my roommate's g1 when you have a  working build :)
12:29 @kmobs| I just registered for classes.  No friday classes.. but 4 biology classes.. woohoo
12:29 +cyanogen| making xbin a squashfs during the build would be nice too
12:29 +cyanogen| but meh
12:30 +cyanogen| it fits on sapphire or dangerspl.. i've got a script to opticharge and squashfs stuff
12:30 +cyanogen| should fit on a plain g1 without the dangerspl
12:31 @kmobs| OPTICHARGE
12:32 @kmobs| koush got the AnyKernel.zip working.  Its pretty sweet
12:34 @kmobs| the cyan color on deskclock is BRIGHT.  Does the color have an alpha option as well?  It should be dimmed a little IMO
12:35 @ChrisSoyars| cyanogen: wes's kernal is building tiwlan with 2.6.29
12:36 +cyanogen| oh yeah thats right, he put the code in the kernel tree huh
12:36 @ChrisSoyars| yeah
12:36 @ChrisSoyars| probably shouldnt be that way but, it works
12:36 @ChrisSoyars| well
12:36 @ChrisSoyars| i guess the broadcom drivers are in the kernal tree
12:37 +cyanogen| yeah
12:37 +cyanogen| i'd like to use the new wl12xx driver but i haven't gotten it working yet
12:38 +cyanogen| bluetooth rfkill might not be working on 2.6.33 for dream/sapphire
12:38 +cyanogen| i can fix that though
12:38 @kmobs| fixitfixit

13:02 +cyanogen| i have to remember to bring mine in from the car before my wife goes to work tonight
13:02 +cyanogen| apparently we don't need to do anything
13:02 @kmobs| I did
13:02 +cyanogen| other than add landscape for the phone
13:02 @ChrisSoyars| ah
13:02 @ChrisSoyars| no its all jacked up according to kmobsy
13:03 +cyanogen| theres an option in config.xml
13:03 +cyanogen| oh?
13:03 @kmobs| yeah we need landscape for phone
13:03 @kmobs| It works fine
13:03 @kmobs| just need landscape for phone
13:03 @ChrisSoyars| but the layouts are all smashed up and jacked up right?
13:03 @kmobs| we also need the ability to dial numbers in phone.apk
13:03 +cyanogen| yeah the layout is ass
13:03 @kmobs| ChrisSoyars: only the incall screen (but not with the config.xml change and stock phone.apk)
13:03 @kmobs| the incall screen is the only thing that didn't rotate
13:03 @ChrisSoyars| ah cool
13:04 @kmobs| with the config change
13:04 @kmobs| the launcher rotated :D

13:28 @thedudeTM| yeah
13:29 @thedudeTM| it made me cry
13:29 +benbuchacher| i ranted to her when she contacted me about flaming

13:30 +benbuchacher| just the HARDcore i am a dumbass and don't even know what linux is
13:30 +benbuchacher| i thought it was an app noob
13:30 @ChrisSoyars| CHEF CENTRAL?
13:30 @ChrisSoyars| wtf
13:31 @thedudeTM| it's not the noobs that have me annoyed here...its the 'zomg get rich quick schemes' that are going to come out of this forum

13:33 +benbuchacher| its going to be one giant clusterfuck is what it is
13:34 @ChrisSoyars| xda is already a giant clusterfuck
13:35 @ChrisSoyars| i want to know who the "seasoned" devs are that are moderating

13:35 @ChrisSoyars| i mean look at this\
13:35 @ChrisSoyars| hello i have a xv6900 verizon vogue android ppl in my thread make roms for it but i want to make mi own roms so i know it has a recovery menu i kno how to get to it but it reads tar files and wat i did was extract its contents and put it in a zip file and it work but, so i guess i just answer my question.
13:36 +benbuchacher| ..
13:36 +benbuchacher| ><
13:36 +benbuchacher| the response
13:36 +benbuchacher| For starters, SDK means Software Development Kit for developing software to run with a certain OS platform.
13:36 +benbuchacher| NDK is Native Development Kit to development software that runs natively in say an Android rom.
13:36 @thedudeTM| Fuuuuuuuuu
13:36 @thedudeTM| seriously?
13:37 +benbuchacher| totaly serious
13:37 @thedudeTM| hate x10
13:37 @ChrisSoyars| BAKN'CAKE
13:38 @ChrisSoyars| Please don't ask for developers to give you access to their kitchens or other unique resources.

13:42 +benbuchacher| cant help it
13:42 @thedudeTM| i just asked mikey about it
13:42 @thedudeTM| and he doesn't even know wtf it is
13:42 @ChrisSoyars| they are trying
13:42 @ChrisSoyars| i understand that
13:42 @ChrisSoyars| but all this info is already out there
13:43 @ChrisSoyars| as cyanogen stated all you need to know is on d.android.com
13:43 @thedudeTM| yeah for sure
13:43 +benbuchacher| http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=667309
13:43 +benbuchacher| there it is
13:43 @kmobs| I just don't think XDA understands android
13:44 @thedudeTM| oh bookake
13:44 +benbuchacher| o ill put the developer.android link too haha
13:44         * thedudeTM feels like a total noob actually
13:44 @thedudeTM| i didn't know about pdk.android.com :(
13:44 @ChrisSoyars| oh shit
13:44 @ChrisSoyars| i even learned something from the cyanogenz
13:44 @ChrisSoyars| didnt know about this PDK page
13:45 @thedudeTM| w00t
13:45 @kmobs| can someone link me to the thread?  I'm tether right now and don't wanna sift through xda
13:45 @thedudeTM| i feel like less of a noob now
13:45 +cyanogen| haha
13:45 +cyanogen| yeah
13:45 @thedudeTM| kmobs the form of doom and gloom http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=613
13:45 +cyanogen| that is a good site
13:45 @ChrisSoyars| yeah i mean i knew everthing was documented
13:45 @ChrisSoyars| i just didnt know they uploaded it anywhere
13:45 @ChrisSoyars| makes sense lol
13:45 @thedudeTM| yeah no shit i have some weekend reading now
13:46 @thedudeTM| i mean, i knew a lot of this..but i bet this fills in some holes (giggity)
13:46 +benbuchacher| haha thedudeTM: i love your sig
13:47 @ChrisSoyars| nice
13:47 @ChrisSoyars| pretty good docs on the build system
13:47 @thedudeTM| ok reason #2123141 i need to get off my lazy ass and start working on sekrit project
13:47 @ChrisSoyars| yarrr
13:47 @ChrisSoyars| slacker
13:47 @thedudeTM| ChrisSoyars: my roommate trumped my learning weekend
13:47 @thedudeTM| you can't tell your mate that he's gonna have to celebrate his birthday without ya
13:48 @ChrisSoyars| you can
13:48 @thedudeTM| which led to a 12 hour drinking binge
13:48 @thedudeTM| i even unstalled twidroid pro for the night
13:48 @thedudeTM| best
13:48 @thedudeTM| idea
13:48 @thedudeTM| evar
13:48 +ciwrl| lol
13:48 @thedudeTM| uninstalled*
13:50 @kmobs| I didn't know about pdk either
13:50 @kmobs| wootwoot
13:50 @ChrisSoyars| haha
13:50 @ChrisSoyars| nice post benji
13:50 @thedudeTM| some devs you guys are
13:50 @ChrisSoyars| call to mods to identify themselves
13:50 +benbuchacher| im curious tho
13:50 +benbuchacher| who got suckered into that
13:50 @thedudeTM| i mean they didn't even invite the 3 most influentual devs i know in android
13:50 @ChrisSoyars| yeah no shit
13:50 @ChrisSoyars| manup
13:50 @ChrisSoyars| kingklick
13:51 @ChrisSoyars| andddd
13:51 @ChrisSoyars| hmm
13:51 @kmobs| blackdroid
13:51 +benbuchacher| htcclay
13:51 @thedudeTM| blackdroid
13:51 @ChrisSoyars| blackdroid gets the win on that one
13:51 @thedudeTM| duh
13:51 +benbuchacher| lol
13:51 +benbuchacher| it was close tho
13:51 @kmobs| they paid him to come work on xda lol
13:51 @ChrisSoyars| people dont understand
13:51 @ChrisSoyars| that there are very few "developers" in the android community
13:51 +cyanogen| i wasn't invited
13:51 @thedudeTM| right?!
13:51 @ChrisSoyars| to me,  a developer is one who WRITES CODE
13:52 @ChrisSoyars| but hey i could be wrong
13:52 +benbuchacher| i agree
13:52 @ChrisSoyars| i just manage developers for a living
13:52 @ChrisSoyars| but what the fuck does that mean
13:52 @thedudeTM| I gues 40,000 aosp installs wasn't enought to make you a dev cyanogen....you're going to have to try harder before XDA recognizes you
13:52 +benbuchacher| i just am obsessed with android and learning
13:52 +benbuchacher| my coding sucks
13:52 @thedudeTM| noob
13:52 +benbuchacher| lol
13:52 +benbuchacher| i admit it haha
13:52 +cyanogen| for reals
13:52 +benbuchacher| i am a grasshopper still
13:52 +benbuchacher| lol
13:53 @ChrisSoyars| building android doesnt mean shit
13:53 @ChrisSoyars| when i decided fuck this shit
13:53 @thedudeTM| no shit
13:53 +benbuchacher| agree
13:53 @ChrisSoyars| i want eclair on my mt3g
13:53 @ChrisSoyars| i built it
13:53 @thedudeTM| if i can do it...it's probably easy
13:53 @ChrisSoyars| i didnt even have an XDA account at the time
13:53 +cyanogen| yeah but like you said, once you actually start figuring shit out, it's way more fu
13:53 @ChrisSoyars| about an hour later i was like WOW
13:53 @ChrisSoyars| WOW THIS IS EASY
13:53 +benbuchacher| yea
13:53 +benbuchacher| i love the feeling of figuring out HOW or why something is happening
13:53 @thedudeTM| agreed
13:53 @ChrisSoyars| thats no fun
13:53 +benbuchacher| or if there are errors solving the problem
13:53 @thedudeTM| knowledge is power
13:53 @ChrisSoyars| sometimes its safe to assume it just works
13:53 @ChrisSoyars| dont ask why
13:53 +benbuchacher| thats the enjoyment i get
13:54 @ChrisSoyars| the best is bugs that appear after having the same code in production for 6 months
13:54 @ChrisSoyars| and its a complete buildfailer
13:54 @ChrisSoyars| those are the ones that interest me
13:54 @ChrisSoyars| shit worked fine for the past 6 months, now all of a sudden its b0rked and nothing changed
13:54 +benbuchacher| lol
13:54 +cyanogen| hahaha
13:54 +benbuchacher| haha
13:54 +cyanogen| i had one of those
13:54 @ChrisSoyars| zombies
13:55 +cyanogen| last week
13:55 +benbuchacher| those are funny
13:55 +cyanogen| everything was all fine
13:55 @ChrisSoyars| yeah we have one here at work right now
13:55 +benbuchacher| when you know you didnt change ANYTHING
13:55 @ChrisSoyars| its some crap with SQL transactions freaking out
13:55 +benbuchacher| android = doing the same thing over and over with differant results
13:55 +cyanogen| then we had a record with a timestamp 1 millisecond before DST
13:55 +cyanogen| and it fucked up our timeseries generation
13:55 @ChrisSoyars| oh wow
13:55 +cyanogen| i was ready to slash my wrists
13:55 @kmobs| hahaha
13:56 @ChrisSoyars| my fav is how we just revamped our issue tracking
13:56 @ChrisSoyars| and all of a sudden its like
13:56 +cyanogen| we do some really evil database queries to generate timeseries data
13:56 @ChrisSoyars| i need to hire more people to deal with production issues
13:56 +benbuchacher| lol
13:56 @ChrisSoyars| cause people are finally actually reporting them
13:56 @ChrisSoyars| instead of just not working
13:56 @ChrisSoyars| our db queries are EVILL to the max
13:57 @ChrisSoyars| we had attempted to create a view that was creating like a 3GB temp table
13:58 @thedudeTM| Android, how the fuck does it work?
13:58 +cyanogen| our schema is actually really nice, but we use soemthing like a materialized view for our analysis since joining 10 tables for these kinds of queries is insane
13:58 @ChrisSoyars| yeah ours is getting better
13:58 +cyanogen| so we can keep the materialized view mostly in the buffer cache
13:58 @ChrisSoyars| we join way toooo much right now
13:59 @ChrisSoyars| but our query activity is werid at best
13:59 @ChrisSoyars| we are heavy heavy read during the day
13:59 @kmobs| hmm my screen isn't turning off
13:59 @ChrisSoyars| and heavier write at night
13:59 +cyanogen| also lends itself to sharding, but i won't be finishing that project
13:59 @kmobs| not sure its due to being tethered and connected to USB
13:59 +optedoblivion| ChrisSoyars: I think we only need like one more person
13:59 @ChrisSoyars| for now
13:59 +cyanogen| we are heavy everything
13:59 @ChrisSoyars| it'll die down
13:59 +optedoblivion| true
13:59 +cyanogen| adding millions of rows a day
14:00 +optedoblivion| once everything is fixxxored
14:00 @ChrisSoyars| yarrr
14:00 @ChrisSoyars| cyanogen: what database backend?
14:00 +optedoblivion| brb gonna migrate to the conference room
14:00 +cyanogen| used to be oracle, but we ditched it for postgres
14:00 @ChrisSoyars| luckeh
14:00 +cyanogen| postgis beats the fuck out of oracle spatial
14:00 @ChrisSoyars| we are on mysql and getting close to adding many millions of rows per day
14:00 +cyanogen| and thats a pretty big part of our app
14:01 +cyanogen| plus oracle wanted $200k to upgrade to the "full" spatial package so we dropped em
14:01 @ChrisSoyars| yeah
14:01 @ChrisSoyars| we are opensource fanboi's
14:01 @ChrisSoyars| and probably going to start using s3 for the bulk of our data storage
14:02 @ChrisSoyars| we will be taking about 100k screenshots of random websites daily
14:02 @ChrisSoyars| that adds up
14:02 +cyanogen| we do both.. our flagship app is closed source, but a bunch of the lowlevel stuff we've done is open
14:02 @kmobs| Wifi is screwing up in this classroom and a lot of people have to register right now.  I set up tethering for them :)Wifi is screwing up in this classroom and a lot of people have to register right now.  I set up tethering for them :)
14:02 @ChrisSoyars| allz i has to say is webkit is a DREAM for rendering content
14:02 +cyanogen| i wrote an extension library for hibernate that adds spatial functionality and abstracts oracle and postgres behind the same api
14:02 +cyanogen| got to lgpl that
14:02 @kmobs| whoops cp'ed twice
14:02 @ChrisSoyars| sick
14:03 +cyanogen| and our ts4j library
14:03 @ChrisSoyars| hibernate is pretty illnana
14:03 @ChrisSoyars| we're 100% python so we are using sqlalchemy
14:03 @ChrisSoyars| hibernate clone
14:03 +cyanogen| which doetimeseries analysis
14:03 +cyanogen| mostly opened that up for the cmu people we work with
14:03 +cyanogen| haven't used sqlalchemy but i see it used all over the place
14:03 @ChrisSoyars| cyanogen should move to FL
14:03 @ChrisSoyars| and get pwned
14:04 @ChrisSoyars| sqlalchemy rocks
14:04 @ChrisSoyars| its sex
14:06 @ChrisSoyars| it sucks for complex queries though
14:06 @kmobs| ChrisSoyars: my dad agreed to get a revo this summer!  Gonna set it up so I can just scp it .nzb files for my family.
14:06 @ChrisSoyars| but it is very flexible, 0.6 just went stable a few days ago
14:06 @ChrisSoyars| and is wicked fast, they ported a lot of it to C
14:06 @ChrisSoyars| kmobs: nice
14:06 @ChrisSoyars| revo rocks
14:07 +optedoblivion| it is complicated for using expression language in SQLAlchemy
14:07 @kmobs| still loving it?
14:07 +optedoblivion| but it isn't too bad once you do a couple.
14:07 @thedudeTM| i still may not get the revo
14:07 @ChrisSoyars| rape
14:07 @thedudeTM| popbox is doing preorders

16:33    thedude|FIRES@| no he came to me
16:33    thedude|FIRES@| 'i heard tim's being a bitch'
16:34            kmobs@| This is how apple is biased.  Sometimes its obvious.. but look how sneaky this is
16:34            kmobs@| With 800 x 480 screens becoming popular over in Android land, it seems obvious that Apple needs to do something to stay competitive resolution-wise, and the boost in pixel density (330 ppi, the Kindle offers 167 ppi by contrast, and the current iPhone packs a mere 162 ppi)
16:34      ChrisSoyars@| kmobs: so, shall i go buy a zi8?
16:34            kmobs@| The just casually sneak the kindle in there
16:34            kmobs@| ChrisSoyars: shrug
16:34      ChrisSoyars@| i am always willing to just #askkmobs instead of figuring it out on my own
16:34      ChrisSoyars@| i just kinda wanna buy something
16:35            kmobs@| I haven't gotten one yet though
16:35      ChrisSoyars@| ive wanted a little HD cam for a while
16:35      ChrisSoyars@| and the price isnt bad at all
16:36      ChrisSoyars@| i like how @Equinix is tweeting earth day tips
16:36    thedude|FIRES@| there we go
16:36      ChrisSoyars@| their datacenters consume enough power to power some crazy number of homes
16:36    thedude|FIRES@| Concerto Moon
16:36    thedude|FIRES@| ugh
16:36    thedude|FIRES@| then he sang
16:36    thedude|FIRES@| fuuuuu\
16:36    thedude|FIRES@| ChrisSoyars: earth day cracks me up
16:37            kmobs@| I like that people are still in denial of the iphone leak
16:37    thedude|FIRES@| so much hipocrasy in one day
16:37    thedude|FIRES@| iphone nano*
16:38    thedude|FIRES@| that's only half the iphone linup
16:38            kmobs@| think so?
16:38    thedude|FIRES@| there is another (imho)
16:38            kmobs@| but its the same dimensions as the current one
16:38    thedude|FIRES@| i just don't see them making the screen smaller
16:38            kmobs@| wouldn't make sense for them to make a BIGGER one
16:38            kmobs@| the screen is smaller though
16:38    thedude|FIRES@| i dunno
16:38            kmobs@| slightly more narrow
16:38    thedude|FIRES@| apple's full of fail
16:38     benbuchacher+| they already made a bigger one
16:38     benbuchacher+| its called the ipad
16:38            kmobs@| but the resolution is doubled in each direction
16:38    thedude|FIRES@| yeah but it's not a phone
16:39            kmobs@| (theory)
16:39    thedude|FIRES@| i see them making an evo/galaxyS size screen
16:39    thedude|FIRES@| and a 3.2ish inch one
16:39    thedude|FIRES@| for the girls
16:39    thedude|FIRES@| and azns
16:39     benbuchacher+| i saw leaked photos that the ipad is just four iphones ductaped together inside
16:39           fembot@| build #19 of cm_sholes started, including []
16:39            kmobs@| if 4.3in becomes the new norm I'm gonna kill someone
16:40    thedude|FIRES@| sorry kmobs
16:40    thedude|FIRES@| i had to leave you
16:40    thedude|FIRES@| bpm must equal dragonforce or higher
16:40            kmobs@| I'm not cool enough to listen to music that hardcore
16:40    thedude|FIRES@| hahahahaha
16:41    thedude|FIRES@| normally i can't take it
16:42      ChrisSoyars@| users are so dumb
16:42      ChrisSoyars@| CAN U UPDATE NEXUSMOD TO FLASH THE TRACKBALL LIKE ON CYANOGENMOD????
16:42      ChrisSoyars@| i feel like responding
16:42      ChrisSoyars@| that is a useless feature, go fuck yourself
16:42    thedude|FIRES@| but
16:42    thedude|FIRES@| can you lol?
16:43         *  thedude|FIRES ducks
16:43      ChrisSoyars@| yes but
16:43    thedude|FIRES@| it is useless
16:43      ChrisSoyars@| it would be wrapped with try/excepts
16:43      ChrisSoyars@| because the stock rom and droid wont do it
16:44    thedude|FIRES@| yeah fuck that
16:44      ChrisSoyars@| jesus
16:44    thedude|FIRES@| i didn't really think it was a big deal anyway
16:44      ChrisSoyars@| i was shooting nerf darts at my whiteboard
16:44      ChrisSoyars@| i got ambushed
16:44    thedude|FIRES@| my led blinks enough

16:45    thedude|FIRES@| nice
16:45            kmobs@| I'm flashing the new CM.  should I push all of those libs?
16:45            ciwrl+| yes
16:45            kmobs@| or should I just push the libs onto what I have?
16:45            ciwrl+| try just opencore though
16:46            kmobs@| because right now I have working setupwizard and stuffs
16:46      ChrisSoyars@| it should back that up
16:46            kmobs@| oh right
16:46            kmobs@| should I just try opencore so we can say if thats the important one?
16:46            ciwrl+|  <+cyanogen> i think the one we needed was libopencorehw
16:46            ciwrl+| [16:05] <+cyanogen> the htc one probably had some gay htc stuff in it
16:46            ciwrl+| yea why not

16:51      ChrisSoyars@| i know
16:52            kmobs@| koush needs a way to do sequential flasshes
16:52            kmobs@| for example: flash Cm and then a kernel
16:52      ChrisSoyars@| rommanager can do that
16:52            kmobs@| it can flash two things at once?
16:52      ChrisSoyars@| yes
16:52            kmobs@| wut
16:52    thedude|FIRES@| yeah

17:06      ChrisSoyars@| if you are connected to an n network though

17:06            kmobs@| well my router is set to N only

17:06            kmobs@| with wpa encryption

17:06      ChrisSoyars@| does it say current bit rate 65Mb/s?

11:45          jeagone+| the only way it really worked for me is if I setup a swaped backend for it
11:46            prash+| compcache did help a lot with my g1, always
11:46         cyanogen+| i added it to the d/s build
11:46            prash+| no other swap
11:46         cyanogen+| at least rzscontrol
11:46          jeagone+| ah
11:46            kmobs@| The human version of the dr is a pussy
11:46         cyanogen+| i shoulda brought my ion :(
11:46            prash+| no one else uses android at work?
11:46            prash+| just gank it
11:47         cyanogen+| well i'm not really supposed to be working on CM at work :)
11:47         cyanogen+| i have nothing to do though since it's my last week
11:47            prash+| but you're cyanogen, and you've quit already
11:47          jeagone+| lol
11:47         cyanogen+| nah they all have droids
11:47          jeagone+| oh man
11:47            prash+| gah, go postal on them so they dont multiply
11:47         cyanogen+| i copied the libcamera.so to the private dir
11:48         cyanogen+| so if anyone gets a device before i go home, try it out :)
11:48          jeagone+| private dir?

11:48         cyanogen+| l: android p:teamd00sh
11:48            kmobs@| but now I have to leav again
11:48          jeagone+| link me a cyan5 for the g1
11:48         cyanogen+| yeah its in there
11:48          jeagone+| i just kanged a g1
11:49            kmobs@| Ill grab it when I get back (an hour)
11:49         cyanogen+| that build includes gapps
11:49            kmobs@| jeagone: its in the private dir
11:49            prash+| im tempted to drive back home to brothers job just to grab the g1
11:49         -!- kmobs is now known as kmobsHAT
11:49         cyanogen+| everything works except for the cam
11:49          jeagone+| this is a g1 that hasn't been used in a while
11:49          jeagone+| i'll root it, and test, heh
11:49         cyanogen+| theres a bluetooth bug too
11:49            prash+| root it? it wasnt rooted already? GTFO jeagone
11:49         cyanogen+| segfault in hcid, but i will fix that later
11:50          jeagone+| it's a uppers
11:50          jeagone+| i just asked him if he still had it, since he got the nexus
11:50          jeagone+| he said yeah, i said give it to me now
11:50          jeagone+| he gave me a 0.0 look and complied
11:50            prash+| haha
11:52          jeagone+| oh sweet, he is running 1.5
11:52          jeagone+| easy rooting
11:52         cyanogen+| flashrec :)
11:52            prash+| wait
11:52            prash+| are there 1.5 rom copies out there?
11:53            prash+| if not dump it for safekeeping
11:53          jeagone+| i'll dump it anyway
11:53         cyanogen+| i really hope the VENC task works :(
11:53         cyanogen+| it seems like it will
11:54          jeagone+| you'll know in like 5-10 mins
11:54         cyanogen+| btw if you are flashing that to a g1, you probably need dangerspl
11:54         cyanogen+| i haven't squashed it
11:54          jeagone+| ok
11:54         cyanogen+| xbin has a lot of shit, needs to be a squashfs
11:55          jeagone+| i used dangerspl on everything.  I don't see why it isn't kind of a requirement
11:55         cyanogen+| i need to add some code that makes it not use /cache/dalvik-cache for system apps on dangerspl
11:55          jeagone+| atleast on the g1
11:55         cyanogen+| cause it fills up
11:56          jeagone+| image dump, rooted, getting the spl now
11:57          jeagone+| crap, I need the radio image no?
11:58         cyanogen+| i used a pretty old version of libcamera source
11:58          jeagone+| i'll update just in case
11:59         cyanogen+| qualcomm has a bunch of their own stuff in theremost of it looks like it in in the liboemcamera
11:59         cyanogen+| but i'm hoping this at least gets basic stuff goin

11:50    optedoblivion+| and we are on verizon (she hates the moto droid lol)

11:54         cyanogen+| gallery3d works on mdpi fully now
11:54         cyanogen+| including orientation

11:55    optedoblivion+| I was just wondering
11:55    optedoblivion+| I might get one for my wife...don't know if she'd let me dev on it though.
11:55         cyanogen+| shouldn't be much different from what we have now
11:56    optedoblivion+| I didn't figure, but would probably have to root it or wait until someone roots it.

12:01    optedoblivion+| on a partition?

13:06    optedoblivion+| well if you get the grub menu

13:08        thedudeTM@| i'm reading up too
13:09        thedudeTM@| i'd hate to reinstall the whole os just to reinstall grub
13:09        thedudeTM@| cause i tried mounting from livecd and it wasn't happy either
13:09    optedoblivion+| you don't have to in order to re-install grub
13:09    optedoblivion+| o_O
13:09    optedoblivion+| should be able to mount the root partition
13:09        thedudeTM@| i could
13:10    optedoblivion+| then do grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/myroot /dev/sdaX
13:10        thedudeTM@| i tried that
13:10        thedudeTM@| gonna try again now that refit seems happy
13:11    optedoblivion+| try doing a grub --recheck /dev/sdaX
13:11    optedoblivion+| see what that returns
13:11        thedudeTM@| k

13:13        thedudeTM@| righ
13:13        thedudeTM@| could not find device for /boot
13:14    optedoblivion+| that is your problem
13:14        thedudeTM@| should /dev/sda3 be umounted
13:14    optedoblivion+| no
13:14        thedudeTM@| i have it mounted and can see /boot
13:14    optedoblivion+| do an fdisk -l /dev/sda
13:14    optedoblivion+| and post 
13:14        thedudeTM@| gonna try reinstall
13:14    optedoblivion+| waitz0rz

13:16        thedudeTM@| i may be able to fix this easily

13:19        thedudeTM@| of course
13:19        thedudeTM@| what's the fun if it's easy

13:19        thedudeTM@| i want lean, mean, fat reducin linux machine

13:23        thedudeTM@| i'm saying ext4 works to boot
13:23    optedoblivion+| LOL
13:23        thedudeTM@| i use ext4 on my laptop
13:23    optedoblivion+| oh oko
13:24        thedudeTM@| with arch
13:24    optedoblivion+| I still use ext2 for boot
13:24        thedudeTM@| i know it's crazy bleeding edge
13:24        thedudeTM@| but i'm lazy
13:24        thedudeTM@| i should have made a /boot partition
13:24        thedudeTM@| i think it's biting me in the ass now
13:24    optedoblivion+| refit might not be able to read ext4
13:24    optedoblivion+| hence the unknown filesystem
13:24        thedudeTM@| it did with ewwboontoo
13:25    optedoblivion+| hm
13:25    optedoblivion+| then I guess I suck
13:25        thedudeTM@| reading this now http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=71792
13:26        thedudeTM@| When I installed Ubuntu, I installed grub to /dev/sda3 (the ext4 partition).  I did the same the first time I installed Arch.  The only difference was that Arch was not recognized by rEFIt and would only be recognized if I installed grub to /dev/sda.  In the end, that's what I did.  I just repaired Windows afterwards, left Mac OS X's bootloader alone, and everything worked out fine.
13:26        thedudeTM@| ^^^ sounds like me
13:28    optedoblivion+| weird
13:28    optedoblivion+| can grub boot OSX?
13:28    optedoblivion+| LOL
13:29        thedudeTM@| yeah a long time ago it did
13:29        thedudeTM@| i'm curious to see how this works out
13:29        thedudeTM@| worst case i plan on blasting the whole machien
13:29    optedoblivion+| http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=85508
13:30        thedudeTM@| yeah
13:30        thedudeTM@| i saw that
13:30        thedudeTM@| fukket
13:30        thedudeTM@| installing grub to /dev/sda
13:30    optedoblivion+| LOL
13:30    optedoblivion+| just curious, why do you need a mac for work?
13:30        thedudeTM@| hahaha
13:30        thedudeTM@| i don't
13:30        thedudeTM@| well
13:31        thedudeTM@| i'm the guy that's in charge of client management
13:31        thedudeTM@| and we're a mac/linux/win school
13:31    optedoblivion+| ah
13:31    optedoblivion+| so you need all three to help troubleshoots
13:31        thedudeTM@| so day 2 i requested a mbp
13:31        thedudeTM@| well id on't do support
13:31        thedudeTM@| but yeah, that's essentially the idea
13:32    optedoblivion+| what is your job title?
13:32    optedoblivion+| j/c
13:32        thedudeTM@| senior IS architect
13:33        thedudeTM@| senior IS client architect, technically
13:33        thedudeTM@| BOOM

13:33    optedoblivion+| awesome!
13:33        thedudeTM@| so weird

13:34    optedoblivion+| nice
13:34        thedudeTM@| hello xwindows
13:34         *  optedoblivion  wishes I could get my internal bluetooth to work
13:34    optedoblivion+| You have inspired me to try again
13:34        thedudeTM@| holy balls
13:34        thedudeTM@| wifi works
13:35    optedoblivion+| If I get that working I will have everything working correctly.
13:35    optedoblivion+| Hellz yah!
13:35        thedudeTM@| i fucking love chakra
13:35        thedudeTM@| they make things so much easier
13:35    optedoblivion+| I still haven't used this chakra
13:35        thedudeTM@| i like it
13:36        thedudeTM@| if you're a kde fan
13:36        thedudeTM@| the livecd is pwnage
13:36        thedudeTM@| they added a graphical installer for noobs (and lazy people)
13:36        thedudeTM@| but it's approaching bloat
13:36    optedoblivion+| I used to like KDE
13:36    optedoblivion+| but now it's so dog slow
13:37    optedoblivion+| I am a minimalist kinda guy.
13:37    optedoblivion+| e16/dzen2/dmeny
13:37    optedoblivion+| dmenu*
13:37    optedoblivion+| even like DWM
13:37        thedudeTM@| yeah
13:37    optedoblivion+| but rendering is too slow for some windows
13:37    optedoblivion+| I wanna hack in tiling support into e16
13:37    optedoblivion+| one day..when I have time.
13:38    optedoblivion+| e17 sucks ballsack
13:38    optedoblivion+| only thing I miss from compiz is wobbly winderz
13:40        thedudeTM@| optedoblivion: tell ChrisSoyars i need him
13:40        thedudeTM@| 17:36  koush well, his exact quote was "well, go ahead and fork builtbot and have it generate the manifest  @thedudeTM  if you want"
13:40    optedoblivion+| ChrisSoyars is out sickz0rs
13:41    optedoblivion+| ChrisSoyars said you could fork buildbot?
13:41    optedoblivion+| I wouldn't see why not...
13:41    optedoblivion+| #teamdouche!
13:41        thedudeTM@| oh
13:42    optedoblivion+| maybe I misunderstand the issue.
13:42        thedudeTM@| koush wants to add the nightlies to buildbot
13:42        thedudeTM@| err
13:42        thedudeTM@| to rom manager
13:42    optedoblivion+| ah
13:42        thedudeTM@| i guess cyanogen is the one to ask
13:42        thedudeTM@| since it's his nightly
13:42        thedudeTM@| i don't care, hosting wise...
13:42    optedoblivion+| thedudeTM: I don't know if ChrisSoyars would go for that
13:42    optedoblivion+| Then it would eliminate TDUpdater
13:42    optedoblivion+| :-D
13:42        thedudeTM@| we've talkeda bout it
13:42        thedudeTM@| right
13:43        thedudeTM@| and if i give koush the server info...he can go nuts
13:43        thedudeTM@| so i'm holding off
13:43    optedoblivion+| I would too
13:43        thedudeTM@| cause once you give koush a semi green light...you've lost control
13:43        thedudeTM@| i hate losting control
13:43    optedoblivion+| yah
13:43    optedoblivion+| koush is that kinda guy
13:43    optedoblivion+| a real...go getter....screw you in the ass....kinda guy :)
13:44    optedoblivion+| Not saying he isn't intelligent or a good guy.
13:44        thedudeTM@| right
13:44    optedoblivion+| He just seems like he can step on ppl easy.
13:44        thedudeTM@| anyone that charges 4 dollars for an updater
13:44        thedudeTM@| doesn't get carte blanch in my book
13:44        thedudeTM@| blanche*
13:44    optedoblivion+| I mean 1.99 would have been exceptable...
13:44    optedoblivion+| but
13:45    optedoblivion+| the projects are open source
13:45    optedoblivion+| IMHO he should have made a donate version
13:45    optedoblivion+| and a full version
13:45    optedoblivion+| for free
13:45    optedoblivion+| I would have donated
13:45    optedoblivion+| the 1.99
13:45    optedoblivion+| 3.99 is really steep
13:45        thedudeTM@| i got the 1.99 version
13:45    optedoblivion+| there is a 1.99 version?
13:45    optedoblivion+| lol
13:45        thedudeTM@| was*
13:45    optedoblivion+| I was just using that as an example
13:45        thedudeTM@| it was 4.99
13:45        thedudeTM@| and nobody bought it
13:46        thedudeTM@| then he made it 1.99
13:46        thedudeTM@| and i got it
13:46        thedudeTM@| then he upped it to 3.99
13:46        thedudeTM@| cause he does this 'for a living'
13:46        thedudeTM@| and the only reason he's doing it
13:46    optedoblivion+| He works for Kiha
13:46    optedoblivion+| for a living
13:46        thedudeTM@| is so that he can sell more rom managers
13:46        thedudeTM@| which cyanogen doesn't get a cut of
13:46        thedudeTM@| so
13:46        thedudeTM@| build your own nightly brah, teamdouche says -1
13:47    optedoblivion+| I think TDUpdater could dominate
13:47        thedudeTM@| time to install some pacakges
13:47        thedudeTM@| hehe
13:48    optedoblivion+| yeah, I think I'm going to try and get my internal BT working

14:35    optedoblivion+| thedude|away: prolly just permissions in the OS

17:26       thedudeTM@| Dear customers, we are going to migrate our servers to a different rack space due to capacity (power) issues. The migration is just down the hall and it wont take more than 1 hour to complete. During this time your VPS server and our website will not be available but rest assured everything will be up and running as usual within 1 hour.
17:26       thedudeTM@| If you have any questions please feel free to reply on this e-mail address.
17:26       thedudeTM@| Thank you.
