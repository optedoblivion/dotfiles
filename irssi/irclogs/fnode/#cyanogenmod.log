13:40  Frog292| Hello, I am sorry for the noob-ish question, but I have tried to find the answer elsewhere - Do I need to update the baseband version for CM to the most recent? or does it do that for me? I am on droidmod 2.01
13:41         -!- Woot|AFK is now known as WootRoot
13:41 @PsychoI3oy| Frog292, CM roms typically don't care about radio version and don't touch it
13:41 @PsychoI3oy| assuming you're on a Droid, I'd ask in #koush
13:42  Frog292| ok, sound good, will do
13:42 @PsychoI3oy| but I know on the HTC side the rom doesn't care about the radio

13:46  tjader| Let's see if it works
13:46  zinx| BlackBishop: stop killing it
13:48  tjader| Yay, it works
13:48  tjader| damn clockwork mod
13:49 @PsychoI3oy| tjader, yeah, the backuptool.sh wasn't running (or not running right) which is why it looked like a non-base flash of CM
13:49 @PsychoI3oy| amon_ra recovery for dream has a crapton more features than CM-1.4 and hasn't had any problems with backuptool
13:50 @PsychoI3oy| but on a G1 you can do all the same things in console that you can do in amon_ra with menu options
13:50  BlackBishop| zinx: well,it was dead for 3 weeks now
13:50 @PsychoI3oy| so it's no biggie

14:15  plum| oh, nvm
14:17  zinx| BlackBishop: what'd you do to it?
14:17  Loonacy| plum: Because CM has a n00b detector and doesn't work right for n00bs.
14:18  plum| Loonacy: ooh i forgot about that

14:50  Loonacy| I think the newer ones do.
14:50  ciwrl| as of 5.0.6
14:51  ciwrl| you can wget it though from cyan's server
14:51  plum| not the g1 version though?
14:51         * Loonacy fires up gwbasic.exe
14:51  ciwrl| not included...it will be, the irrsi binary on the serve works
14:51  plum| ciwrl: how to do that? o.o i'm not well versed in wget
14:51 @PsychoI3oy| plum, open up terminal of choice, su
14:51  ciwrl| wget http://n0rp.chemlab.org/android/apps/irssi
14:52  plum| cool, i'll go try it :) just a sec
14:52 @PsychoI3oy| plum, cd to somewhere that's capable of supporting permissions (/system/bin [though you'll have to remount], /data/misc, /system/sd/ etc.)
14:52  Loonacy| plum: You don't have to wget, you can just download it and put it on your phone through ADB or something.
14:52 @PsychoI3oy| then run that wget
14:52  clowe| kaie': that nexus holster looks real chinsy
14:52 @PsychoI3oy| then
14:52 @PsychoI3oy| chmod +x irssi
14:52  plum| oh, ok xD
14:52  Loonacy| plum: wget is very handy, though.
14:53  Loonacy| I'm forced to use curl at work, though. :(
14:53  Loonacy| Stupid macs.
14:53  clowe| kaie': goog car mount is quality++
14:53 @PsychoI3oy| depending where you put it, you may have to specify the full path to run it
14:53 @PsychoI3oy| e.g.
14:53 +koush| sudo port install wget
14:53 @PsychoI3oy| /system/sd/irssi
14:53 +koush| :)
14:53 @PsychoI3oy| emerge -av wget
14:53 @PsychoI3oy| oh wait it's part of gentoo by default
14:53 @PsychoI3oy| that's what emerge uses to download
14:53 +m0zes| hurray gentoo
14:54 +thedudeTM| hahaha
14:54  Loonacy| sudo apt-get install apt-get
14:54 @PsychoI3oy| eggzachary
14:54  dang| (Mind you, sudo is not part of gentoo by default...)
14:55 @PsychoI3oy| no
14:55         -!- Boldfilter_ is now known as Boldfilter
14:55 @PsychoI3oy| and I like it that way

14:55 @PsychoI3oy| Loonacy, no, su
14:55 @PsychoI3oy| i'm lazy, i leave an Eterm su'd most of the time
14:56  dang| I aliased emerge to sudo emerge.
14:56 @PsychoI3oy| another default in gentoo is to have $PS1 bright red for root and green for normal users
14:56 @PsychoI3oy| which is good
14:56         * m0zes loves default bash colors in gentoo
14:58         * jbeitler is just happy when he sees people not using windows

14:59  Loonacy| It has to happen eventually.
15:00  kaie`| ChrisSoyars--
15:00  ciwrl| Assid if its anything new, youll get it quicker than ota ;)
15:00  Assid| thats true
15:00  kaie`| kmobs works on launcher2 aswell ya?
15:00 +m0zes| unless it is a radio ;)
15:00 @ChrisSoyars| kaie`: ---
15:00 @PsychoI3oy| hell, CM probably already has half or more of what might be in an OTA in the next week
15:00  ciwrl| exactly
15:01  kaie`| i had some bitching ideas for launcher2... they arent original but i had it on dream/magic.
15:01  ciwrl| m0zes we'd get the radio from an ota b4 hand too
15:01  ciwrl| ;)
15:01  Assid| the ota is expected next week?
15:01  kaie`| so says the french
15:01 @PsychoI3oy| no
15:01 @PsychoI3oy| Assid, i have no idea
15:01  kaie`| the french have been wrong before
15:01  Assid| err.. you just said it >?
15:01  kaie`| he said 'might'
15:01 @PsychoI3oy| Assid, I'm just saying that if we expected an OTA a week from now, CM would already have some big chunk of the stuff in there, because the OTA is probably based on code dumped in AOSP a month ago
15:02  Assid| oh you mean what we get from CM next week would be ahead of the update
15:02  Assid| oh ok
15:02 @PsychoI3oy| I can't speak to Google's schedule
15:02  dyndragon| regarding radio flashes: what im gathering tells me basically that the radio flashes contain the firmware for the hardware on a particular phone. Kind of like low level drivers, yes? and that's why if you pull the plug on a radio update, you brick your phone
15:03 @PsychoI3oy| dyndragon, yeah, mostly specific to gsm/wifi/gps/bluetooth/etc, but also some audio related things and maybe some camera stuff
15:03 @PsychoI3oy| it's called a 'radio' but it's been shown to fix other bugs too
15:04  plum| will there be a dropbear UI in cm 4.4?
15:04  dyndragon| PsychoI3oy: so radio versions are then independent of ROMs, as in, you dont necessarily need to have a particular radio for a particular ROM
15:04 @PsychoI3oy| as far as CM goes, it's never been dependent on radio version
15:04 @PsychoI3oy| other things like SPL obviously are
15:04 @PsychoI3oy| but CM doesn't really care
15:04 +m0zes| dyndragon: depends, sometimes roms make use of things in newer radios. I am pretty sure you don't want to run a 1.x radio with CM...
15:05 +m0zes| (on a g1 ;))
15:05 @PsychoI3oy| m0zes, ask any freshly rooted g1 user
15:05 @PsychoI3oy| it'll function
15:05  Assid| alrite im hitting the sack
15:05  Assid| gnight guys
15:05 @PsychoI3oy| there's known bugs that're solved by the 2.x radios
15:05 @PsychoI3oy| but it'll boot/function/etc
15:05 +m0zes| PsychoI3oy: updating the radio was always the first thing I did ;)
15:05 +m0zes| fair enough
15:06  dyndragon| well, yes, it's always good to be updated. thanks. when I was presented with all the different radios for the N1 when i started getting into this 2 weeks ago all I could do was follow instructions. now i want to know why!
15:06  finfin82| i phone which says unkown 32B ... it boots with ra-recovery H ... i can flash Rom-RAv1.1.0H-signed-update.zip and it boots, when i flash cm it doesnt boot anymore
15:06 @PsychoI3oy| bt and wifi are finicky together on 1.x, gps and ... bt? are mutually exclusive
15:06 @PsychoI3oy| finfin82, if the H recovery is booting then it's EBI1 and/or 32A
15:06  finfin82| htc magic
15:06 @PsychoI3oy| either way, use the EBI1/32A patch after flashing CM
15:07  finfin82| do you know where i will get it?
15:07  finfin82| ;-)
15:07  Chopes| CM is amazing btw, thats all i have to say
15:07 @PsychoI3oy| perhaps the 'latest version' page on the wiki?
15:08  kaie`| so i went to go buy one of those blendtech blenders
15:08  kaie`| 400 dollars for the cheapest
15:08 @PsychoI3oy| kaie`, yeah
15:08  kaie`| ummm no

15:09  kaie`| i havent been reading mmy 'blend digest' apparently
15:09  kaie`| who the fuck else makkes good blenders
15:09  finfin82| is it a single zip-file PsychoI3oy?
15:09 @PsychoI3oy| yes
15:09  finfin82| can't find it :-/ blind?

15:10  plum| does Android Terminal Emulator in market (as opposed to Terminal Emulator by BetterAndroid) allow you to recall the last command issued by scrolling up on the trackball?
15:11 @PsychoI3oy| plum, it's not the terminal that limits that, it's the shell
15:11 @PsychoI3oy| try ash or bash
15:11  plum| ah :(
15:11  plum| sounds more complicated
15:11  plum| :x
15:11 @PsychoI3oy| not really
15:11 @PsychoI3oy| type ' ash ' hit enter
15:11 @PsychoI3oy| tabcomplete works too
15:12  plum| scroll up still doesn't work...
15:12 @PsychoI3oy| hmm
15:12 @PsychoI3oy| I've been on connectbot's "local" for so long
15:12  plum| it prints this: ^[[A
15:13  plum| i'll try the other terminal...
15:13 @PsychoI3oy| odd, that's (iirc) the scancode for up
15:13 @PsychoI3oy| and if the terminal's printing it, it's interpreting it but the shell doesn't get it
15:13 @PsychoI3oy| ash should work
15:14  plum| i'm on g1, btw
15:15  plum| don't know if that contributes to it

15:16 @PsychoI3oy| dontron, either corrupted fonts or the locale you're using isn't working right
15:17  plum| neither terminal app works for that on g1 i guess
15:17  plum| oh well
15:17 @PsychoI3oy| though German should be working
15:17 @PsychoI3oy| plum, use connectbot
15:17  dontron| http://i41.tinypic.com/axfipd.png <-- i have reflashed but its the same
15:18  plum| i didn't like connectbot last i used it ages ago...
15:19  dontron| PsychoI3oy:  my locale is german..
15:19 @PsychoI3oy| plum, connectbot local + ' su -c /system/xbin/bb/ash ' as a startup command == happy PsychoI3oy
15:19  plum| lol :)
15:19 @PsychoI3oy| dunno dontron
15:20 @PsychoI3oy| i haven't seen reports of it
15:20  dontron| okay PsychoI3oy  i wait 4 the next generation of 4.2.16 :)
15:22  dontron| i think its when the name is longer than the icon
15:23  Vachounet| had the same problem in french with that font
15:23  dang| dontron: Squares like that are an indication that the font doesn't have a glyph for that character.
15:23  dang| Usually, it's because the font is missing support for a particular language.
15:24  dontron| dang: no isnt every app that the name is longer than the icon.
15:24  dang| dontron: Then it's the locale's split character that's the problem, most likely.
15:24  dontron| the fiont shows also ä ö ü :)

16:35  riku|taxevade| and it takes forever for firefox to navigate

16:35  riku|taxevade| well for me, its more of a preference
16:36  Loonacy| Right now, 5 tabs in chrome, 629MB.  9 tabs in FF, 104MB.

16:44 @riku|taxevade| o.O
16:44  crashsystems| skiquel: IIRC chrome did not send more info to google than the auto-complete feature in google search
16:44  c|mell| i saw that it happened to someone else http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Android%20Market/thread?tid=43611f90a3677d28&hl=en

16:44 @riku|taxevade| Loonacy, well if chrome uses alot of memory, the application is sure hte hell using it properly
16:44  Adola| Anyone have the 2200 mah battery for the G1?

17:13  Nauren| why do the self employed have such a low minimum
17:14  zinx| because the govt. wants you to work for a company
17:14  EddieRingle| get my hippie vibe going
17:14  Valerin| i think taxes were started by steve jobs' relatives.... cuz he sucks anyway
17:14  bri3d| because otherwise its a common evasion strategy
17:14  bri3d| to be "self employed" and get paid under the table
17:14  bri3d| so they make the limit low to discourage that
17:14  zinx| yarite
17:14  Nauren| except my dad that actually fucking is self employed
17:14 @riku|taxevade| wtf i hve noidea how to do this 1099-div lol

17:15  Valerin| riku|taxevade, you dont fill out a 1099... thats just for your information to put on your 1040
17:15  zinx| you have to pay a crapload of taxes on self-employed money too, but that's because normally the company pays half of it
17:15  EddieRingle| riku|taxevade: confused? :P
17:15  zinx| (so you never see it, and thus do not know you're being taxed so heavily)
17:15  bri3d| yup

14:01  Haraken| (I used to work at geek squad)
14:01  mcosmi| Loonacy: depends what type of customer you are...if you're my grandma...no geeksquad is great ;)
14:01  mcosmi| they also scan your hd free of charg for porn ;)
14:01  LeeJunFan| lol, I see some dumbass on craigs wanting to trade an iphone for a blackberry.
14:02  xkahn| I once was paid to order a computer from Dell for someone.
14:02  mcosmi| heheh
14:02  xkahn| Could they have ordered it from Dell themselves? Sure.
14:02  xkahn| But!  When Dell eventually got the order wrong, it was me who had to handle the problem
14:02  LeeJunFan| xkahn: yeah, I've been there. I've done network/computer work all my life (37yrs old), technology scares a lot of people and they are so set in their ways they don't want to learn.
14:03  xkahn| LeeJunFan: exactly.
14:03  xkahn| Just because something is easy doesn't mean everyone wants to try it
14:03  Haraken| uhg how long does this initial charge take
14:03  Haraken| it's been an hour T_T
14:03  RussellHolly| sweet HTC is sending me a new Nexus One
14:04  Assid| RussellHolly: you think you can help me with this launcehr2 issue
14:04  markatto| i hear sprint is getting the nexus one eventually
14:04  Haraken| RussellHolly, was yours broken?
14:04  canadiancow| [13:58:40] <Loonacy> mcosmi: Is Geek Squad a ripoff?
14:04  canadiancow| yes
14:04  markatto| anyone know if there's going to be a cyanogenmod for the cdma version of the nexus one?
14:04  RussellHolly| Assid: if you didnt Nandroid, you should probably do a full wipe and re-flash
14:05  RussellHolly| and in the future, NANDROID
14:05  canadiancow| i know someone who called geeksquad.  they came.  spent 2 hours.  charged him like $90.  and they didnt fix his router.
14:05  Wasabeh| markatto: probably
14:05  Assid| RussellHolly: okay.. will do that.. how do i do a full wupe and reflash?
14:05  RussellHolly| Haraken: i had dust under the screen, but thought i was screwed because i voided the warranty
14:05  markatto| Wasabeh: of course, the evo is going to be very tempting
14:06  Haraken| RussellHolly, they honored the warranty even though you flashed it?
14:06  markatto| i dunno if i want to invest the time in developing an evo mod myself though
14:06  RussellHolly| Haraken: yeah, he said it was a hardware issue, so it was fine
14:06  Haraken| ohh nice
14:06  Haraken| that's really good to know
14:07  Haraken| I'm getting insurance on my phone, and if I can't get warranty to fix it if it breaks then the phone will just have to be "lost"
14:07  Assid| is there a howto on doing a full wipe and re-flashing
14:07  canadiancow| thats fraud
14:07  canadiancow| :(
14:07  Haraken| though I won't be flashing mine anytime soon so I don't have to go that route
14:07  Psylink| Assid: what is your problem w/ launcher2 btw, scrolled up but never saw where you said what was wrong
14:07  Haraken| canadiancow, not if it really is lost :P
14:07  Haraken| xD
14:07  Assid| force close on launcher2

14:08  Assid| i basically had CM5.0.6 then i patched it with pershoot's patch for helix compatibilty.. and now when i uninstalled helix.. and reflashed 5.0.6 as per PsychoI3oy suggested yday.. im down witha  abroken laucnher
14:08  Psylink| did you have helixlauncher2 then upgrade to 5.0.6 or what though
14:09  LeeJunFan| Assid: are you using app2sd?
14:09  Psylink| you need to clear the data for it and it should be fine
14:09  LeeJunFan| Psylink: yeah, it's either that or permissions.
14:10  LeeJunFan| Just thinking if he is using app2sd and reflashes, it won't clear the ext-sd anyway will it?
14:10  Assid| Psylink: i had helix, upgraded to 5.0.6, faced force close.. uninstalled helix.. got patch.. reinstaleld helix..  now i wantto go bac to stock .. and use the new helix someone mentioned
14:10  Psylink| just go get the new one
14:11         -!- skiquel is now known as skiquel|away
14:11  Assid| okay i wiped cache
14:11  Assid| Psylink: right for that i need a working launcher2
14:11  Assid| i cant get a working launcher
14:11  Psylink| no you dont
14:12  Psylink| you have the sdk and adb working?
14:12  Assid| yes
14:12  Psylink| http://helixproject.ruqqq.sg/download.php?id=21
14:12  Psylink| that is the launcher2 0.7
14:12  Psylink| put that in your sdk/tools/
14:13  Psylink| then adb push Launcher2_0.7.apk /system/app/Launcher2.apk
14:13  Psylink| should fix your problem
14:14  Assid| hold on.. i just cleared my cache.. so .. initial boot takes its own sweet time
14:15  Assid| if i reflashed CM5.0.6 shouldnt my laumcher be the stock now?
14:15  Psylink| did you wipe?
14:15  Assid| noppe
14:15  Psylink| then you still have the data from the helixlauncher
14:15  Assid| only wiped my cache .. but thats now
14:16  Assid| oh
14:16  Psylink| i always reflashed new CM builds overtop and instead of clearing my data, i just pushed helixlauncher while it was in the bootanimation, when the animation hits blue, would adb devices
14:17  Assid| why not thereafter
14:17  Psylink| then just push helixlauncher through adb
14:17  Assid| failed to copy 'Launcher2_0.7.apk' to '/system/app/Launcher2.apk': Read-only fil
14:17  Psylink| adb remount
14:17  Psylink| then push it

14:18         -!- kmobs is now known as kmobsHAT
14:18  Assid| okay that got me up
14:18  Assid| now how od i uninstall helix completely
14:18  Assid| so i can do a fresh load
14:19  Psylink| that is the new one if you downloaded from the link i gave you
14:19  wroberts1| salt n pepa -- push it
14:19  Psylink| dont need to remove/readd
14:20         -!- kmobsHAT is now known as kmobs
14:20  Assid| yes i know.. but theres some widget which was in stock.. i can see when i move EXTREME left
14:20  Assid| which didnt really go away
14:21  LeeJunFan| Is there a difference between Helix2 and Launcher2?
14:21  Assid| Psylink: so is there a way i can force it back to normal launcher?
14:22  Psylink| if you want stock back, download cm5.0.6, open the zip file and go to system/app/ extract the Launcher2.apk  then push it
14:22  Assid| oh
14:22  EddieRingle-G1| yellow, everyone
14:23  ciwrl| yellow
14:23  Psylink| LeeJunFan: helix has the icon dock at the bottom or stock dots, more screens, etc
14:24  LeeJunFan| Psylink: ah, okay.
14:24  Psylink| i enjoy the 5 row app drawer way too much to go back to helixlauncher, but i miss the shortcuts :/
14:24  Assid| Psylink: forceclose if i do that
14:24  Psylink| Assid: cause you need to clear data
14:24  Assid| oh
14:24  Assid| ok
14:25  Assid| wait clear data? or cache
14:25  Psylink| before switching to stock from helix, or helix to stock, you need to adb remount then adb shell rm -r /data/data/com.android.launcher2
14:26  Assid| done.. lets see what happens
14:26  Psylink| once you do that, the force close will stop on stock, and i may be wrong but i believe that would correct your shortcut problem on helixlauncher w/o going back to stock
14:28  Assid| okay after rm .. apparently you also need to repush launcher2
14:28  Psylink| ya, rm data then push
14:29  Assid| just curious.. what about what pershoot's patch did
14:29  Psylink| from droidundergroud.com?
14:30  Psylink| all that is, is helixlauncher 0.6 patched to work w/ 5.0.6, but ruqqq updated helixlauncher 0.7 to work and fixed the slowness of 0.6
14:31  Assid| this one: http://droidbasement.com/db-blog/?p=135
14:31  Psylink| ya
14:32  Psylink| when 5.0.6t1 came out, helixlauncher wasnt working properly due to changes from google code i believe, and cyanogen had to help him fix it.  which is where the one on droidbasement
14:32  Psylink| oh i said droidunderground before lol (tired)
14:34  Psylink| but ruqqq had 0.7 beta working then (standalone version, but works as systemapp too) for donators only. so i think thats why the 0.6 went up on droidbasement.  and ruqqq/arctu finally released it public and standalone version also
14:35  Haraken| RussellHolly, did you tell htc up front that you flashed your phone or did you let them find out?
14:38  Assid| tanks Psylink
14:39  Psylink| np

15:06  ikevin| i try to download one, and it won't work, apn's settings are ok, because a can send mms
15:06  speef| I've used pretty much all open source software for about 15 years now and ha've never seen so much "kang" drama.  I think all the juvenille disputes I've witnessed prior together are less than the amount of android drama

16:04  osaeed| i get only 1 hour on my batteruy before its dead
16:04  Loonacy| It's a bit bigger, though.
16:04  osaeed| need a new one i think
16:04  Loonacy| I hope you're not talking about your phone.

16:07  osaeed| i want 22,000mAh
16:07  osaeed| now we are talking

16:09  Loonacy| Way back when i was working for the IRS and they wouldn't let us plug our CD players in, i put together a circuit that let me plug my cd player into a big sealed lead acid battery so i wouldn't have to buy AA batteries for it.

16:22  canadiancow| they wouldnt let you use POWER outlets?
16:22  canadiancow| holy shit
16:22  Loonacy| canadiancow: No, power costs money!
16:22  canadiancow| oh
16:22  canadiancow| wow
16:22  canadiancow| ive only been ever limited by "security" reasons
16:22  canadiancow| i.e. "dont plug your shit into our computers"
16:23  canadiancow| "we dont want your viruses"
16:23  Loonacy| They even bought a bunch of new computers (this was a long time ago) that had cd drives in them, and they went and unplugged them inside so we couldn't use them.
16:23  stratos| lol
16:23  stratos| makes sense

16:26  EddieRingle| can anyone who has an N1 tell me if they think the UI is faster/more responsive than on the G1?
16:26  canadiancow| it is
16:26  canadiancow| lol
16:26 @SatanR1| EddieRingle seriously? lol
16:26  EddieRingle| canadiancow: like, smooth?
16:26  Chopes| yes...
16:26  canadiancow| its the same OS on faster hardware
16:27  Chopes| everythign is better
16:27  EddieRingle| would you say it's iPhone fast?
16:27  Chopes| ...
16:27  canadiancow| ...
16:27  canadiancow| i wouldnt say the iphone's fast
16:27  EddieRingle| responsiveness, i mean
16:27  EddieRingle| I know the phone is faster than the G1 AND the iPhone
16:27  Chopes| they have screen tests on engadget....
16:27  xndr| EddieRingle: yes.
16:27  Chopes| between n1 and iphone and all dem
16:27  canadiancow| i would say that my iphone lags a lot more than my n1
16:27  canadiancow| engadget does controlled tests
16:27  EddieRingle| I just want to know if the laggy UI on my G1 is an Android thing or a hardware thing
16:27  canadiancow| in the real world, the iphone isnt "faster" than the n1
16:27  xndr| EddieRingle: I'd say n1 > g1
16:28  Chopes| n1 > g1
16:28  Loonacy| EddieRingle: The iPhone is fast... when i throw it out the window of a moving car.
16:28  Chopes| actually
16:28  Chopes| android has an iPhone tossing app
16:28  Chopes| iToss
16:28  Chopes| final level you have an iphone
16:28         * Chopes shutsup
16:29  riku| o.o we know
16:29  riku| EddieRingle, i'd tell you this.  i tried to go back to my G1 for a few days.   it was hell.
16:29  osaeed| g1 is awesome
16:29  riku| EddieRingle, it was like going from super smartphone to clunky flip phone with no internet :/
16:29  Loonacy| riku: I'll show you hell.
16:29         * Loonacy swaps riku's N1 with an iphone 1g
16:29  osaeed| if u disagree, ill come over your house and butt slap you son
16:29  riku| .............

16:30  osaeed| :)
16:30  riku| osaeed, ;)
16:30  EddieRingle| anyways....
16:30  osaeed| :>)
16:30  riku| EddieRingle, the UI is smoother than G1, yes there is lag, and yers i do believe that is android related :o
16:30  EddieRingle| riku: Java related?
16:30  riku| yea
16:31  EddieRingle| alright
16:31  EddieRingle| that's all i needed to know
16:31  riku| EddieRingle, :)  however, its hardly noticeable on a 1ghz processor
16:31         * EddieRingle begins porting the Android platform to ARM assembly
16:31  riku| on a G1 its VERY noticeable
16:31  riku| o.O
16:31  EddieRingle| it's gunna be stupid fast
16:31  riku| :O
16:31  osaeed| solder the n1 arm processor onto the g1 m/b and there ya go
16:31  riku| osaeed, no, :/
16:31  osaeed| lol
16:31  riku| i don't think theres enough ram to handle a 1ghz processor o.O
16:31  riku| lol
16:32  EddieRingle| seriously though, why is it so hard to manufacture an N1 with a keyboard?
16:32  EddieRingle| that's all I ask
16:32  riku| EddieRingle, its not hard
16:32  riku| its something i dont' see HTC doing in the near future
16:32  riku| t-mobile released the mytouch slide probably in contract with HTC
16:32  riku| actually, not probably, truth ^^
16:32  osaeed| i hate the software keyboard on these phones
16:32         * EddieRingle wishes the VK never existed
16:32  osaeed| i prefer the slide out kb
16:32  EddieRingle| the concept of VK's anway
16:32  EddieRingle| anyway*
16:32  riku| lol
16:33  xndr| onscreen keyboard isn't that bad
16:33  Loonacy| VK's aren't bad sometimes.  They just suck at certain tasks.
16:33  xndr| i came from a physical one
16:33  osaeed| my fingers are bigger than my toes
16:33  riku| o.O
16:33  xndr| you adapt

16:33  riku| :o
16:33  osaeed| yea i have that
16:33  riku| lol
16:33  Loonacy| osaeed: Some mad doctor swapped your feet and your hands at birth.
16:33  osaeed| i suck at it
16:34  osaeed| Loonacy: I believe so
16:34  riku| Loonacy, he wasn't mad, he fortold this.
16:34  osaeed| lol
16:34  riku| he knew, HE KNEW.  that osaeed would try and use a VK
16:34  riku| HE KNEW
16:34         * riku whispers:  "he knew"
16:34  osaeed| lol!
16:35  Loonacy| riku: Wanna go hang out in the closet for a few minutes?

16:36  EddieRingle| i can't stand twidroid
16:36  EddieRingle| dunno why
16:36  EddieRingle| I just don't like it
16:36  riku| i've always found myself moving back to twidroid after all the twitter apps i've used
16:36  riku| i can't stand twicca, do dark, and theres no "light" theme
16:37  riku| swift is ok, but its not as fast as the app dev says it is
16:37  riku| if i had to pick between the two, i'd still pick twicca, more features
16:37  riku| but, i can't stand it so i'm still on twidroid
16:37  riku| EddieRingle, for you, twicca
16:37  vinic| twitter needs to start using color coding
16:37  riku| vinic, lol
16:37  vinic| because that is pretty much the best thing in twicca
16:38  riku| yea EddieRingle, twicca allows you to color code certain tweeps
16:38  EddieRingle| riku: ok, next category
16:38  riku| ok listening ^^
16:38  vinic| twicca needs to have list color support
16:38  riku| o.

16:49  riku| j/k
16:49  riku| lol
16:49  EddieRingle| cereal?
16:49  EddieRingle| lol
16:49  riku| YES ... for cereal
16:49  EddieRingle| the problem is, GitHub has full access to their API
16:49  riku| EddieRingle, and knows how to impliment it
16:49  riku| lol
16:49  EddieRingle| as in, access to features I don't have access to
16:50  EddieRingle| btw
16:50  EddieRingle| I need monies
16:50  riku| EddieRingle, why not ask?
16:50  Loonacy| EddieRingle: I have a penny.
16:50  EddieRingle| riku: lemme tell you something about the guys at GitHub
16:50  riku| i'm sure if they wanted to support OS they may be willing to let you in on some of the github shit
16:50  EddieRingle| you ask them about something on GitHub's support site
16:50  riku| EddieRingle, are they self centered bastards?
16:50  EddieRingle| and the add it to "The List."
16:50  EddieRingle| "The List" is neverending
16:50  EddieRingle| and it never grows shorter
16:51  riku| lol
16:51  EddieRingle| "The List" is what they use to add ideas that they won't implement, but make it seem like they're doing something
16:51  riku| until the list is thrown away lol
16:51  riku| where's the list?
16:51  EddieRingle| the only time something gets done, is if I make it an issue
16:51  EddieRingle| by harrassing them
16:51  riku| lol
16:51  EddieRingle| and annoying them
16:52  EddieRingle| riku: "The List" is not a physical thing, it's a mental list
16:52  riku| EddieRingle, prove it :o how do you know there isn't a list!
16:52  riku| :o
16:52  EddieRingle| riku: because there is no way you can fit that many tickets on one list, that's why!
16:53  riku| UGH
16:53  EddieRingle| they've probably got like, 20 bagillion items on there!
16:53  riku| I WANT TO WATCH 3 :/
16:53  riku| lame
16:53  EddieRingle| anyway
16:53  EddieRingle| homework/
16:53  EddieRingle| j/k
16:54  BUGabundo| anyone here knows the twicca devs?
16:54  EddieRingle| lol
16:54         * BUGabundo lol slaps EddieRingle till he drops on the floor

16:54  BUGabundo| damn
16:54  riku| BUGabundo, srsly why?
16:54  BUGabundo| I would love to contact them
16:54  EddieRingle| BUGabundo: I say 'lol' because we were just talking about it
16:54  riku| what i want is WHITE BACKGROUND
16:54  EddieRingle| then there was something about GitHub
16:54  EddieRingle| and then I passed out
16:54  riku| i hate the dark shit
16:54  EddieRingle| and scurried my pokemon to the nearest Pokemon Center
16:54  BUGabundo| riku: ALL android is black
16:55  riku| if twicca wasn't so dark i would be able to READ IT BUGabundo
16:55  riku| lol
16:55  BUGabundo| but most app that try light collors suck

10:56  asnoka_| which makefile should i modify ?or just set the env variable?
10:56  asnoka_| thanks a lot
10:56  asnoka_| FYI,i am build android 2.1 for dream.
11:00  jbeitler| I just need to get this off my chest real quick.. WTF is vmware thinking making everyone's life hell with this vmware server not compiling against anything newer than Ubuntu 9.04? do they hate us now or what? damn
11:00  jbeitler| ok I am better now
11:01  xkahn| jbeitler: there is always HyperV or XEN or KVM
11:01  jbeitler| this is true.. but I don't wan tto have to convert 15 vms
11:02  jbeitler| that is a lot of unnecessary work
11:02  xkahn| Huh.  I thought most of them could read each other's disk images
11:02  jbeitler| xex maybe.. KVM gets weird
11:02  jbeitler| HyperV is winblows only correct?
11:04  xkahn| jbeitler: Looks like you have to convert: qemu-img convert vmware_file.vmdk -O qcow qemu_file.img
11:04  xkahn| jbeitler: HyperV is Windows host only, yeah
11:05  jbeitler| yeah no windows as primary boxes in my world.. Windows = me cry my self to sleep
11:05  xkahn| jbeitler: blog.bodhizazen.net/linux/convert-vmware-vmdk-to-kvm-qcow2-or-virtualbox-vdi/
11:05  xkahn| gah!  Stupid chromium!
11:05  xkahn| jbeitler: http://blog.bodhizazen.net/linux/convert-vmware-vmdk-to-kvm-qcow2-or-virtualbox-vdi/
11:06  xkahn| jbeitler: I'm no fan of Windows, but some people are, so I mentioned it.  ;)
11:06  BUGabundo_remote| xkahn: I know the frustration
11:06  jbeitler| xkahn: oh I know how to do it.. its just bullshit that I am going to have to.. that is all I am saying
11:06  BUGabundo_remote| please update.... seems lattest build fix many of the copy buffer bugs
11:06  xkahn| BUGabundo_remote: Lemme see if my repo has a fix; I prefer not to compile my own if I can help it
11:07  BUGabundo_remote| ahh
11:07  xkahn| jbeitler: Yeah.  Seems like there should be a better way
11:08  jbeitler| BUGabundo_remote: what is the build number on yours by chance?
11:08         -!- strat0s is now known as stratos
11:08  jbeitler| and that is all I am asking for xkahn.. a better way technology is a cunt sometimes
11:09  Stephan|| anyone know where i can find apk names?
11:10  Stephan|| i'm trying to follow barebones removal instructions but apk names are sometimes different from apkname.apk
11:11 @prash| you can use wildcards
11:11  BUGabundo_remote| jbeitler: 5.0.382.0~svn20100420r44999-0ubuntu1~ucd1
11:11 @prash| ama.apak for anything like amazonmp3
11:11 @prash| er apk*
11:12  Stephan|| prash: i follow but the pm uninstall <apkname> are often different from actual apk.name
11:12  Stephan|| apkname.apk*
11:12  xkahn| jbeitler: "KVM can run a .vmdk image but it is probably more useful to convert to a KVM-friendly format. "
11:12 @prash| what im saying is use wildcards still, it should work unless the devs are idiots
11:12  xkahn| jbeitler: http://gh-linux.blogspot.com/2009/04/kvm-update-by-chris-wright.html
11:13  Stephan|| prash: lmafo i doubt koush is an idiot ;)
11:13 @prash| he is :)
11:13 @prash| run an ls koush
11:13 @prash| find out the apk names
11:13 @prash| on /data/app directory
11:13 @prash| or /system/app
11:14  Stephan|| prash: ok sounds good i'll try that
11:14  Stephan|| prash: thanks
11:14  RussellHolly| when building cyanogen do i need to have my phone connected?
11:14 @prash| or just run an ls in the /system/app and youll see the list of installed packages, narrow it down by doing ls /system/app/*ama* to just get anything matching amazon, etc, basically you can wildcard what you want to remove
11:14 @prash| RussellHolly: from source? probably not
11:15  BUGabundo_remote| what's the XDA link for the latest HTC_IME ?
11:15  RussellHolly| prash: when i run ./extract-files.sh i get error:device not found
11:15  BUGabundo_remote| for desire
11:15  RussellHolly| following the instructions on the cyan wiki explicitly
11:16 @prash| RussellHolly: well for that particular step you do have to have the device hooked up, thats extracting the goodies from your device so you can use em
11:16 @prash| not exactly the building part yet :P
11:16  RussellHolly| probably in recovery right?
11:16 @prash| hmm theres a guide i thought, but hangon
11:18 @prash| RussellHolly: its just adb commands, so no not in recovery (well you can if your recovery has adb capabilities)
11:18  Stephan|| prash: the ls under /system/app gives me <apkname.apk> but not <apkname> for pm uninstalls
11:18 @prash| Stephan|: use apkname.apk
11:19 @prash| for pm uninstalls
11:19 @prash| are you following the barebones wiki page?
11:19  Stephan|| prash: yes
11:19 @prash| ill go fix it
11:19  Stephan|| prash: ok
11:20 @prash| not sure why whoever made the wiki page left out the .apk im assuming the device is looking for an apk name not app name
11:20 @prash| Stephan|: pm uinstall apkname doesn't work right?
11:21  Stephan|| prash: for pm uninstall the names differ at times
11:21  Stephan|| for example
11:21  Stephan|| rm -f /system/app/Browser.apk
11:21  Stephan|| pm uninstall com.android.browser
11:21 @prash| ah i see what youre saying
11:21  Stephan|| would be corresponding pm uninstall
11:22 @prash| ill bug someone to fix it on the wiki
11:22  Stephan|| prash: sounds good
11:31 +bcrook| RussellHolly: Are you trying to build cm5?
11:32         -!- thedood|away is now known as thedudeTM
11:32  BUGabundo_remote| ... or an atomic bomb
11:34         -!- skiquel|away is now known as skiquel
11:34  terevos| hmm..  just rooted my Droid and installed Cyanogen from the instructions.. but it seems I don't have any google apps..  am I missing something?
11:34 +bcrook| terevos: Yes. You need to flash a google addon
11:35  terevos| oooh
11:35  terevos| so I just download that, reboot into recovery and do it like an update.zip ?
11:35 +bcrook| yeah
11:36 +bcrook| http://briancrook.ca/android/nexus/gapps/gapps-passion-EPE54B-signed.zip - this is the newest for the Nexus. I dont know if they differ for droid
11:36 +bcrook| Considering that says "passion" not "sholes" I assume they do
11:37  RussellHolly| bcrook: yeah
11:37 +bcrook| koush: Are you around
11:37 +bcrook| RussellHolly: Did you get it working?
11:38  terevos| this says use the passion one - http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/index.php?/topic/526-cyanogenmod-for-droid-v5062-04192010/
11:38  RussellHolly| bcrook: attached my phone and ran ./extract-files.sh and i got a string of remote object '/blahblahblah' does not exist
11:39 +bcrook| terevos: Then use that link I gave you
11:39 +bcrook| or the one there. mine is probably faster than mediafire
11:39  terevos| downloading now
11:39 +bcrook| RussellHolly: You have adb set up?
11:39  RussellHolly| yeah
11:39 +bcrook| RussellHolly: And was the phone booted?
11:40 +bcrook| or was it in recovery
11:40  RussellHolly| bcrook: im in recovery with the sys mounted
11:40 +bcrook| RussellHolly: Just do it booted.
11:40 +bcrook| it worked perfectly for me
11:40  RussellHolly| ooooookie
11:41 +bcrook| RussellHolly: And if you are building with Google you need to extract your Google files too
11:41 +bcrook| if you arent, you just need to flash the google addon
11:41  Laserbeak43| http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-20002892-37.html
11:41  BUGabundo_remote| bcrooku shouldn't be hosting that... its non distributble legally
11:43 +bcrook| BUGabundo_remote: Yep. Dont care.
11:44  BUGabundo_remote| bcrook if you ever disappear, you will be missed
11:44 +bcrook| if I get C&Ded, I win
11:44 +bcrook| lol
11:44 +bcrook| Chris has it hosted too
11:44  BUGabundo_remote| shiu
11:44  BUGabundo_remote| don't let them know :)
11:45 +bcrook| BUGabundo_remote: do you have ROM Manager?
11:47 +bcrook| wesgarner: How goes the MT3G 3.5
11:48  BUGabundo_remote| bcrook nope. should I ?
11:48  RussellHolly| bcrook: i should have debugging on, but i can't find it. Where is settings is it?
11:49 +bcrook| BUGabundo_remote: Its good. I am just wondering if it works with the ports.
11:49 +bcrook| RussellHolly: Applications i think
11:49 +bcrook| RussellHolly: Applications>Development
11:49  RussellHolly| yep, found it
11:49 +koush| bcrook: sup
11:49  RussellHolly| awesome, it's working
11:50  wesgarner| lol havent worked on it yet, had some stuff going on
11:50 +bcrook| koush: Ooh. Do you need a .js thing for my ports on ROM Manager?
11:50 +bcrook| wesgarner: lol, fair enough
11:50 +bcrook| stuff is very ominous sounding
11:50  RussellHolly| and now i wait for make
11:50  wesgarner| lol ominous? just some relationship crap
11:51 +bcrook| lol
11:51 +koush| bcrook: for your 32a kernels?
11:51 +bcrook| koush: yes sir
11:51 +koush| whats your github name
11:52  wesgarner| so I hear cyanogen is going to do eclair for dream/sapphire now
11:52 +bcrook| wesgarner: Why
11:52  wesgarner| bcrook: why what
11:52 +bcrook| koush: bcrook, I dont have anything on there
11:53 +koush| bcrook: did cyanogen release a new dream/magic build?
11:53 +bcrook| koush: Not yet. I'm just wondering what you need for it to work
11:53 +bcrook| wesgarner: Why do you think that.
11:53 +koush| bcrook: oh
11:54  wesgarner| bcrook: Chris said he was gonna do it
11:54 +koush| bcrook: scroll down to hte bottom where it says 32a
11:54 +koush| http://github.com/koush/ROMManagerManifest/blob/gh-pages/cyanogenmod.js
11:54 +koush| bcrook: you'll notice that one of the parts to the ROM package is your kernel
11:55 +koush| wesgarner bcrook: gave you both access to that repo
11:55 +bcrook| koush: So you maintain the manifest for everything?
11:55 +koush| bcrook: no, just for some stuff
11:55 +koush| bcrook: i maintain all the CM stuff, and some N1 stuff. There's like a dozen droid themers though that maintain their own manifests.
11:55 +bcrook| koush: Okay. So is that a 32A version someone would pick or is it an optional add on for the regular CM
11:56 +koush| bcrook: its a 32A version
11:56 +bcrook| okay. I meant for cyanogen.
11:56 +koush| bcrook: scroll down to the 32B, you'll see its basically the same thing, minus the kernel package.
11:56 +bcrook| Okay cool. Do you need something on my end or is it all good
11:56 +koush| nah, if nothing is changing kernel wise, i got it handled
11:56 +koush| otherwise i'll need the url to the new kernel
11:56 +bcrook| so its all working now?
11:56 +koush| yes
11:57 +bcrook| okay. I can edit that file (I think) if a new one comes out
11:57  asnoka_| hi folks,anyone can tell me how to disable armv5te vfp support in the cyanogenmod makefile,it seams adding this option will lead libdvm crash
11:57 +koush| cool
11:57 +bcrook| koush: Hope you can revert anything ridonkulous I do lol
11:58 +bcrook| wesgarner: Doesnt that crush OE?
11:58 +koush| bcrook: :)
11:58 +bcrook| good. I suck at github
11:58  BUGabundo_remote| soooooo
11:59 +bcrook| I see a change that needs to be made. I will try it now
11:59  BUGabundo_remote| I should install this new gig ?
11:59  BUGabundo_remote| ROM Manager
11:59 +bcrook| yes
11:59  BUGabundo_remote| where is it ?
11:59 +bcrook| and give koush money for it
11:59 +bcrook| Market
11:59  wesgarner| bcrook: lol yea
11:59  wesgarner| oh well
11:59  BUGabundo_remote| sure
11:59 +bcrook| wesgarner: Maybe Chris will fail
11:59  BUGabundo_remote| if he accepts my back
11:59 +koush| bcrook: what change?
11:59  BUGabundo_remote| already fighting paypal and slideme for my money back
11:59 +bcrook| koush: little url change
11:59 +koush| bcrook: ah gotcha
11:59 +bcrook| BUGabundo_remote: What ahppened
11:59 +bcrook| ?
12:00 +koush| bcrook: incidentally i've been pointing to your and chris's urls for gapps. i assume thats fine? :p
12:00  BUGabundo_remote| 4 bucks
12:00  BUGabundo_remote| if any CM4 would come out
12:00  BUGabundo_remote| I would pay for it
12:00 +bcrook| koush: Yep.
12:01  BUGabundo_remote| http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.koushikdutta.rommanager
12:01 +bcrook| BUGabundo_remote: Yeah its nice. It lets you basically manage backups, flashing, everything from the OS. It reboots, does its thing, and boots back up
12:01 +bcrook| plus koush is awesome
12:01 +koush| :D
12:01  BUGabundo_remote| col
12:02 +bcrook| bah ssh keys and github. I loathe you...

12:07  BUGabundo_remote| really?
12:07 +bcrook| yeah
12:07  BUGabundo_remote| but I like amon_ra
12:07 +bcrook| its worth it. dont worry
12:07 +bcrook| no u dont
12:07 +koush| you can flash back
12:07 +koush| scroll down
12:07 +koush| its not a huge deal lol
12:07 +bcrook| except it breaks ROM Manager
12:08 +bcrook| BUGabundo_remote: You never need recovery. I am telling you.
12:08  BUGabundo_remote| so can I flash from here ?
12:08 +koush| yes
12:08  BUGabundo_remote| the clockwork recovery?
12:08 +koush| yes
12:08  BUGabundo_remote| or manually ?
12:08 +bcrook| BUGabundo_remote: You can do EVERYTHING
12:08 +bcrook| automagic
12:08  BUGabundo_remote| its all disabled
12:08  BUGabundo_remote| I'm lost :(
12:08 +koush| press Flash Recovery
12:08  BUGabundo_remote| so app installed

12:18  BUGabundo_remote| doh

12:19  Chaddledee| Yes
12:19  Chaddledee| Hell fucking yes
12:20  underdog`| Excellent, then I will continue to express excitement.
12:20 @cyanogen| BUGabundo_remote:  i'm working on a top sekrit project, see github
12:20  BUGabundo_remote| :(
12:21  BUGabundo_remote| I saw a bunch of commits today already
12:21 +koush| CAYANAGEN Y r u checkin Dreamz and magicz stuff in2 githab
12:21 @cyanogen| goal is a super-minimal 100% working eclair
12:21 @cyanogen| no lwps or any fancy shit
12:22 @cyanogen| i will use industrial espionage, social engineering, whatever it takes
12:22  BUGabundo_remote| and kill OE in the work
12:22 +koush| cyanogen: think camera is broken for eclair (from my hacking to get eclair working on dream/sapphire). though wes may have fixed that?
12:22 @cyanogen| no
12:22 @cyanogen| not killing OE
12:22 @cyanogen| goal is different
12:22  BUGabundo_remote| oh ?
12:22 @cyanogen| and hopefully OE will even benefit
12:22 @cyanogen| OE will have more features
12:22  BUGabundo_remote| koush: this rom recovery takes MUCCHHHHH longer then the amon one
12:23 @cyanogen| i'm trying to get the guts all working
12:23 +koush| BUGabundo_remote: yeah lol, backup takes forever.
12:23 @cyanogen| i've got 2.6.33 working 100%, wifi bt all that good shit on dream & sapphire
12:23 +koush| BUGabundo_remote: i just found out why the other day... the cool "status" you see. it takes up around 75% of the backup time.
12:23  BUGabundo_remote| I bet
12:23 +koush| BUGabundo_remote: so i'm gonna make that optional. lol.
12:23 +koush| BUGabundo_remote: otherwise it backs up in like 1 minutes.

12:41  mdmadph| mdmadph: kills my phone like there's no tomorrow.
12:41  Wasabeh| good idea
12:41  Haraken| you can use craigslist for accompanying by the lake as well, but people tend to buy/sell/trade on craqigslist more :)

12:51 @PsychoI3oy| the commit makes it pay attention to changes locally, push tells the website about it

12:55  plum| sup
12:55  plum| i have a question...
12:56 +bcrook| ....
12:56  Nauren| kmobs, bcrook: know what prevents one from recording calls on the N1?
12:56  plum| if my computer is plugged into ethernet, but my phone is on wifi, will i still be able to access the phone from ssh?
12:56 +bcrook| Nauren: No idea.
12:56  plum| i believe they're the same connection
12:56 +bcrook| plum: Same network, yes
12:56 +bcrook| If its the same network
12:56  plum| hmm... i might be on another one then
12:56  Nauren| plum: yeah, it will get an IP in the 192.168 range
12:56 +bcrook| unless you change from that lame subnet
12:57  thedudeTM| plum: yes
12:57 +bcrook| plum: Same router=same netowkr
12:57 +kmobs| Nauren: something about the radio
12:57  Nauren| let me guess, yours is 1337.1337.1337.1337
12:57 +bcrook| network*
12:57 +bcrook| Nauren: lol no. 200.0.0.x
12:57  plum| Nauren: you're right
12:57  plum| :P
12:57  Nauren| ah, if it's the radio, that would explain why nobody has fixed it.
12:57  plum| well on the computer (ethernet) the ip is something like 115.112.x.x
12:58  plum| but the phone is 10.127.x.x
12:58 +bcrook| plum: Is this at work or something
12:58  plum| bcrook: yeah
12:58 +bcrook| plum: oooh. umm. probably not
12:58  velazcod| maybe they separated the wired network from the wireless
12:58  plum| they might have blocked the ports too
12:58  Bicou| Hi! I've read somewhere that the N1 used only 256MB of its 512M, is it the case with the latest CM kernel?
12:58 +bcrook| Bicou: No.
12:58 +bcrook| Hasnt been for a while
12:58 +kmobs| nope
12:58  Bicou| you mean no for stock, no for CM or no for both?
12:59 +kmobs| cm uses all the ram
12:59  velazcod| Bicou no for CM, stock hasnt been updated yet
12:59  Bicou| right
12:59  Bicou| would have been weird if CM used only half, wouldn't it ;)
12:59  velazcod| rumors say next stock update will include this fix
12:59  Bicou| thanks guys!
13:00  Bicou| yeah that's what I guessed but I wanted confirmation
13:00  Bicou| I've been using CM since I've got my N1 so I didn't know there was this issue with stock
13:01 +bcrook| yeah
13:01  Nauren| what's the reason it didn't use the full 512?
13:01 +kmobs| velazcod!
13:01 +kmobs| Nauren: old kernel didn't support it
13:01  Nauren| ah
13:01  Nauren| snapdragon that new?
13:02  Bicou| I don't get how they can make a device in which the soft doesn't support the hard
13:02         * velazcod says kmobs' karnals don't work!
13:03  Nauren| Bicou: could have changed the specs somewhere due to cost, or there might not have been a good enough reference kernal
13:03         * thedudeTM says velazcod is doing it wrong
13:03  plum| whatever happened to the overvolted kernal by ChrisSoyars on xda?
13:03  thedudeTM| plum: thread = deleted
13:03  plum| haha aww
13:03  plum| that was fun
13:03  thedudeTM| agreed
13:03 +bcrook| lol
13:03  velazcod| LOL
13:04  BUGabundo_remote| c u latter
13:04  Bicou| Nauren: the cost of the 256M wasted ram should have made them to either get a working kernel or remove 256M
13:04  Bicou| millions of device * price of 256M = money
13:04  velazcod| kmobs thedudeTM worked last night after a 3rd wget
13:04  Bicou| maybe not millions of N1 though :p
13:04 +bcrook| they pulled an Apple and gave us miraculous features that the original phone should have had
13:04  Nauren| I doubt the cost between 512 and 256 isn't as much as you think Bicou
13:05  Nauren| and they haven't even sold 200k afaik
13:05  plum| is skype out on android yet?
13:05  NexVision| its easily 32 to 42 cents per unit
13:05  Nauren| plum: for verizan
13:05  velazcod| plum only for verizon
13:05  plum| what O_o
13:05  Bicou| Nauren: even if it's one buck, 200k bucks is still something
13:05  plum| there must be some way to get around that??
13:06  plum| hmm... i guess it's not really that big of a deal actually. you're on the phone as it is
13:06  plum| how about dropbox?
13:06 +bcrook| coming, apparently
13:07  plum| want
13:07 +bcrook| yep

13:07 +bcrook| its awesome
13:07  Ice_9| hope it works on the Incredible when it comes out

13:14  Assid| heya
13:14  Assid| had a question regarding network unlocking
13:14  thedudeTM| does anyone in here have a mobile i5 520m and runs linux?
13:15  Bicou| err, Google/HTC sell them in the US, why not outside?
13:15  Assid| as i understand everyones allowed 1 unlock code every 90 days
13:15  plum| mdmadph: it's kinda useless too i think, without a front-facing camera all you can do is just use the "call" and im feature
13:15  Assid| so if person b buys a phone from person a
13:15  Assid| can person b unlock said phone
13:15  mdmadph| plum: yeah -- I'm figuring they're mostly just trying to sell phones by saying "now supports skype!" when it won't even work on Wifi.  It tells you to turn it off.
13:16  Wasabeh| kmobsHAT: kernel is working great, gotten alot better batterytime with it
13:16  mdmadph| Anyone here running the hack to make their Dream/G1 run at 614MHz?
13:16  plum| that's same as iphone skype mdmadph... but you can spoof it to think you're on wifi... maybe someone will figure out how to spoof it on verizon too
13:16 +bcrook| fuck, I have 2 full rows of recent apps but the third row wont fill. :(
13:17  thedudeTM| i won't care about skype till i can see nekkid girls with it
13:17 +bcrook| so close....
13:17  mdmadph| plum: does the iphone skype only work on wifi?  Can't remember.
13:17  plum| mdmadph: it's supposed to. the almighty steve jobs has dicktated that it should.
13:17  plum| but the cydia community has a few workarounds
13:17  mdmadph| But it won't right now?
13:18  plum| officially or unofficially? it works for me unofficially on edge
13:19  Assid| skype works on wifi ?
13:19  Wasabeh| Gonna play around with g earth, that should drain the battery some more
13:20  mdmadph| So, the iPhone skype won't work wifi for Verizon, but will for At&T -- what's up with that? :\
13:20  plum| whoa mdmadph, i thought it would only work on wifi on verizon
13:20  plum| at&t doesn't want the bandwidth sap that skype would give if people used it over data connection
13:21  mdmadph| plum -- nope, was revealed the other day that verizon didn't want it to work on wifi at all -- the program supposedly tells you to turn off Wifi before skype starts.
13:21  markatto| that is indeed weird
13:21  plum| pff, wow
13:21  mdmadph| Verizon wanted all Skype calls routed over the regular phone network first -- uses them as some sort of proxy, kinda like TruPhone did on Android.
13:21  markatto| does verizion have bandwidth caps?
13:21  mdmadph| Something to do with federal wiretapping laws.
13:22  markatto| so they're trying to get overage charges?
13:22  plum| i think it's because verizon wants people to only be able to use it on verizon's network.
13:22  mdmadph| Verizon supposedly does, but they don't release them of course.
13:22  mdmadph| Probably all those reasons.
13:22  mdmadph| Honestly...
13:22  velazcod| markatto read the small letters on your contract. Most if not, all, carriers do have a cap
13:22  velazcod| at least 5gbs
13:22  plum| since android is multi-carrier, the only way to ensure that someone on tmobile is using it, wifi or non-wifi, is to only allow it on verizon's network
13:22  mdmadph| it could be just because they're under exisiting subpoenas to allow the Feds to listen into phone calls, and there's no easy way for them to do that to wifi-only skype calls.
13:23  plum| that could be it also, as much as it hurts to admit
13:23         * plum doesn't like the idea of people snooping in on his calls
13:23  mdmadph| that's what I heard, sadly enough.
13:23  plum| :(
13:24  mdmadph| plum: they always have been, and always will be. ;)
13:24  plum| how has at&t gotten around it then?
13:24  mdmadph| plum: Nothing we can do about it, just keep your noses clean. ;)
13:24  mdmadph| plum: They're really nothing to worry about.
13:24  plum| lol i've got nothing to hide anyway, i just don't like people breathing down my neck everywhere i go and with everything i do
13:24  bri3d| plum: it's likely verizon are just thinking further ahead than AT+T
13:25  mdmadph| Okay, just did the 10mb ram hack on my G1 -- why did I not do this sooner.  Seriously, why.  I'm stupid.
13:25  plum| mdmadph: does the 10mb ram hack lower stability at all?
13:25  velazcod| mdmadph the 10mb are taken away from video, games might be choppy
13:25  mdmadph| plum: only for games
13:25  plum| ohh that's right i forgot...
13:25  mdmadph| velazcod: yeah, don't really play them -- thought it was an all right trade.
13:26  plum| velazcod: does that count on 2d games as well?
13:26  plum| i don't really have any 3d games on the g1, it's too unstable as is
13:26  velazcod| mdmadph its fine just letting u know, just in case
13:26  mdmadph| velazcod: no prob -- I wouldn't do this to my Droid when I get it, but on the G1 it's worth it.
13:27  plum| mdmadph: where did you get that 10mb hack? i might look into it
13:27  mdmadph| plum: http://www.absolutelyandroid.com/10mb-ram-hack-for-cyanogenmod-version-4-2-15
13:27  mdmadph| seems to be the main page for it.
13:28  mdmadph| instructions are dead simple.
13:28  plum| cool, i'll try it :) thanks
13:28  Assid| as i understand everyones allowed 1 unlock code every 90 days, so if person b buys a phone from person a; can person b unlock said phone? ?
13:28  mdmadph| no prob
13:28  velazcod| Assid i think its 1 unlock per phone line
13:28  plum| Assid: it would be per tmobile/whatever account
13:28  velazcod| Assid last year I requested 5 unlocks the same day, different phone numbers, same account (family plan)
13:29  mdmadph| so, when I request an unlock key, and they give it to me, I can't do anything with it until i get another SIM, right?
13:29  plum| mdmadph: that's right
13:29  mdmadph| Ah
13:29  plum| just ask for your friend's for a bit
13:29  mdmadph| Is it kosher to sell my phone locked, but give the person the unlock key?
13:30  mdmadph| plum: has to be a SIM from another carrier though, right?
13:30  Assid| so i have a friend who has a blackberry hes been using for a couplke of years.. but hes on tmo
13:30  plum| mdmadph: you'll generally get higher price offers if you say it's unlocked and have it unlocked as is...
13:30  Assid| i can ask him to get me the unlock code? even though i buy a 2nd hand phone?
13:30  plum| and that's right, mdmadph
13:30  mdmadph| plum: Ah, thanks.  Need to find me an AT&T user around where I live. :P
13:30  plum| Assid: that should work
13:30  Assid| im actually looking for a good g1
13:30  mdmadph| Assid: Hey, hey hey
13:31  Assid| plum: sweet.. the guy whose selling it.. is acting strange
13:31  Assid| hes like i cant use my unlock code fo you .. you arrange it yourself
13:31  mdmadph| Assid: Yeah, some people are weird.
13:31  Assid| mdmadph: ?
13:31  plum| Assid: if all else fails you can just get the unlock code after 90 days. not too bad
13:31  mdmadph| Assid: oh, no -- just I'm selling a good G1. :P
13:31  Assid| where you atand how much
13:32  mdmadph| Trying to get $100 USD for it, at least
13:32  Assid| plum: im in india.. my sis is coming down.. shes gonna just carry it for me

13:44 +bcrook| koush: Yay. I didnt fuck up.
13:44  plum| osaeed: go to dealextreme.com, they have a $7 webcam that requires no drivers. small as a cricket
13:44 +bcrook| koush: What do you know about android frameworks? everything?
13:44 +koush| bcrook: yeah, i know a good amount
13:45  osaeed| isnt that for skir....  uses???

13:45 +koush| bcrook: sure
13:45  osaeed| NICE plum
13:45  osaeed| i didnt even see it
13:45  osaeed| trying now
13:45  plum| win
13:45  Chopes| wtf
13:46  Chopes| president of the col. rockies died
13:46 +bcrook| koush: Thanks. I am trying to add a 3rd row to the recent apps dialog box. I have it expand with a 3rd row but it isnt being populated with icons
13:46 +bcrook| Chopes: There is a president of the Rockies
13:46 +bcrook| ?
13:46  Chopes| the baseball team
13:46 +bcrook| oh lol
13:46 +bcrook| fail
13:46  osaeed| i thought u were gonna say president obama died or something
13:46  plum| now here's a question. will the webcam software have issues if you have the 10mb hack?
13:47 +bcrook| osaeed: he is president of more than the mountains
13:47  osaeed| oh
13:47 +bcrook| plum: Does your video work? like camcorder?
13:47  plum| bcrook: i haven't installed the 10mb hack yet, trying it now
13:49 +bcrook| koush: http://github.com/cyanogen/android_frameworks_policies_base/blob/eclair/mid/com/android/internal/policy/impl/RecentApplicationsDialog.java
13:49  Wasabeh| damn
13:50 +bcrook| koush: I added another 3 throws to the xml here: http://github.com/cyanogen/android_frameworks_base/blob/eclair/core/res/res/layout/recent_apps_dialog.xml
13:50  Wasabeh| the phone died before i could check uptime :(
13:52  osaeed| Plum: works
13:52  plum| nice osaeed
13:52  osaeed| it works on Skype beautifully
13:53  plum| i'm still looking for where the hell i downloaded the 10mb hack to
13:53  osaeed| what is that btw?
13:54  plum| osaeed: it partitions 10mb of the gpu to use for extra ram. reduces stability of 3g using opengl... but i don't really have any 3d games that i know of, and i have nandroid, so it doesn't matter to me
13:55  osaeed| wow
13:55  osaeed| thats cool
13:55  mdmadph| osaeed: yeah, I just flashed it -- works stable as hell.
13:55  plum| very nice for the g1 but other phones have more resources so i wouldn't do it for them
13:56  mdmadph| don't even notice it, expcept that everything's faster and I have more free ram now.
13:56  mdmadph| yeah, the G1 was kinda unique in it's extremely tiny amount of RAM. :(
13:56  plum| and its amazing keyboard
13:56  mdmadph| aye, that's too.
13:57  mdmadph| Nothing compares to that keyboard.
13:57  plum| if this webcam works... i'll forever think of android as better than iphone
13:58  osaeed| trust me if u can get laid, you can get the camera working on ure phone
13:58  plum| lol
14:00  plum| hahahaha it works
14:00  plum| dude i'm on chatroulette at work now
14:00  charansingh| i think housing of my nexus is dislocated, i can feel it
14:00  plum| amazing
14:00  osaeed| Nice
14:01  osaeed| it was damn easy to get it working
14:01  plum| agreed, osaeed
14:01  plum| i used to have an old crappy webcam that i had to press random unlabeled buttons in a certain order (had to guess every time) to get it working
14:01  plum| this is MUCH better
14:02  osaeed| and its portable
14:02  osaeed| well camera is portable.. but this is like all in one device
14:03  osaeed| my email, camera, pron, games, remote desktop, what can u ask for?
14:03  plum| i could ask for better remote desktop actually... last time i dabbled in that, it was quite laggy
14:04  osaeed| ure right
14:04  osaeed| which one did u use?
14:04  osaeed| Im using android vnc
14:04  plum| wow, i don't have to press the menu button like 3 times to get the screen to turn on. this 10mb hack is good :D
14:05  plum| i used android vnc also but i gave up when i couldn't get it to work on my NAT router
14:05  osaeed| oh
14:05  osaeed| for the server side, i used realvnc
14:05  osaeed| ultravnc doesnt work
14:05  plum| same here
14:05  osaeed| it may work, prob i have to get rid of encryption mode
14:06  osaeed| did swype work for you?
14:06  plum| yeah it did :) it's very nice
14:06  plum| only thing i wish is that it would have easier input for chickenpecking typing
14:07  plum| cause if i type like "osaeed" i have to type it letter-by-letter cause it's not in the dictionary... and it thinks i want to swype my finger to the next key
14:07  plum| that kinda thing
14:08  plum| brb gotta fix mysql
14:12  Chopes| yo
14:14  Chopes| urgh, whats the PC word for white dude?
14:15  Ostebaronen| pc word?
14:15  Ostebaronen| is there a term such as PC word?
14:16  sunjon| chopes: cracker?
14:16  sunjon| or "whitey" maybe
14:17  kep0ne| caucasian?
14:17  sunjon| i think "whitey" is PC
14:17  sunjon| when it isn't preceeded by "KILL"
14:18  ciwrl| so then whats blacky?
14:18 +m0zes| cocky
14:18  ciwrl| touche
14:18 +m0zes| :)

14:31  npassaro| hello
14:31  plum| sup npassaro
14:31  npassaro|  I have a question about compile wlan driver for Android Nexus one
14:31  npassaro| how do that?
14:31  npassaro| i have the bcm source code
14:31  npassaro| but i dont know to compile for a kernel modified by me
14:32  plum| npassaro: i think you would get the best results by asking at #android-dev
14:32  plum| most of the people there would probably know
14:32  npassaro| ok
14:35  plum| just give it a little time, someone will answer eventually i bet
14:35  npassaro| ok. thanks
14:36  phh| npassaro: muh ? I though bcm driver is in nexus source ?
14:36  phh| anyway, most of the time it's make ARCH=arm -C /where/are/your/kernel/sources M=/where/is/bcm/driver
14:37 +bcrook| koush, I put my shenanigans up on my github, whether you feel like laughing at a java noob: http://github.com/bcrook
14:38 +koush| bcrook: sorry was listing my macbook up on the ebay. Is this the change where the third row is not showing up on the recent apps list?
14:38 +bcrook| koush: lol yeah
14:38 +bcrook| ebay takes so long to do simple shit
14:38 +koush| bcrook: find this xml thingy com.android.internal.R.layout.recent_apps_dialog)
14:39 +koush| look for a file called recent_apps_dialog.xml
14:39 +koush| you will need to add more shit in there to get teh buttons to show up
14:39 +bcrook| koush: Yeah I edited that: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2992899/3row_recent_no3row.png
14:39  Haraken| anyone know how long it usually takes to see a refund from htc after they receive your nexus one? :(
14:39  terevos| ok..  so I'd like to request some help here.  I'm trying to chmod 4755 some files on my /sdcard (Moto Droid running latest Cyan). I keep getting an "operation not permitted" though.  Any ideas?
14:39 +koush| bcrook: i dont see the xml file as having been edited
14:39         * Haraken wants to order but has to wait for the refund to process first
14:39 @PsychoI3oy| terevos, vfat/fat32 doesn't support permissions
14:40  ciwrl| terevos obvious question, you running as su?
14:40  ciwrl| and PsychoI3oy's comment
14:40  terevos| yes.. su

14:40 +bcrook| its there
14:40  terevos| PsychoI3oy:  oh yes.. good point..
14:40 +bcrook| koush: This is what the dialog looks like: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2992899/3row_recent_no3row.png
14:41 @cyanogen| you can't chmod 4755 files on /sdcard
14:41 @cyanogen| it's vfat
14:41 @cyanogen| it has no permissions
14:41 +koush| bcrook: okok you did add it
14:41 +koush| bcrook: wtf it should work
14:41 +koush| bcrook: lemme see the codez0rz

14:42 +bcrook| rattled
14:42  Chopes| woo
14:42  terevos| cyanogen:  so is there no way to run a .sh script from a vfat system?
14:42  Chopes| just banged out an 11 page paper in 2 hours
14:42 +bcrook| koush: oops, wrong rep
14:42 +bcrook| o
14:42  plum| terevos: you can. just do in terminal: sh /sdcard/scriptname.sh
14:43 +bcrook| koush: http://github.com/bcrook/android_frameworks_policies_base/blob/eclair/mid/com/android/internal/policy/impl/RecentApplicationsDialog.java
14:43  blunden| terevos: or you could just put it on /data and run it from there
14:43 +koush| bcrook: i suspect activitymanager is only keeping track of 6 tasks.
14:43 +koush| bcrook: let me check
14:43  terevos| I'll try putting it in /data   - it doesn't seem to run from the sdcard.. even using "sh blah.sh"
14:43  blunden| as long as you don't wipe it will stay there after upgrades too
14:44 +bcrook| koush: yeah, I looked. nothing obvious. to me at least.
14:44  ciwrl| Chopes good job!
14:44  Chopes| indeed

14:47  Chopes| in CM can i compose a text message to multiple recipiants? if so, how?
14:48  ciwrl| jbeitler what radio you on now?
14:48  ciwrl| check baseband in settings > about phone
14:48  ciwrl| Chopes add a , after each name
14:48  dcplaya| whats going on everyone
14:49  jbeitler| ciwrl: 32.26.00.24U-4.04.00.03_2
14:49  Chopes| its not letting me add a ,
14:49  Chopes| i type out their name in the to box, hit it, try and push the , but nothing happens
14:49  ciwrl| jbeitler you have the newest radio, you can try going down to the OTA 4.03 radio instead
14:49  Chopes| only the first name shows up there
14:49  ciwrl| chopes, is there a comma inserted already?
14:49  jbeitler| hmm ok thanks ciwrl
14:49  Chopes| nope
14:49  Chopes| it ends in a >
14:50  Chopes| like First Last Mobile <(230)number>
14:50  dcplaya| Chopes are you trying in the native messaging app?
14:50  Chopes| yes
14:50  Chopes| errr
14:50  Chopes| no
14:50  Chopes| rofl
14:50  ciwrl| ...its working on mine
14:50  Chopes| im using google voice
14:50  ciwrl| lol
14:50  Chopes| should i be using the other sms program? lol
14:51  dcplaya| voice hasnt updated the app to allow multiple receipants for sms yet
14:51  ciwrl| idk if gv suppo^ what he said
14:51  dcplaya| their webpage can do it and they have said they will update the app with that same support
14:52 +koush| bcrook: looking now
14:52 +koush| bcrook: wtf where does getRecentTasks even get implemented
14:52 +koush| bcrook: there's some remote thing that implements it, which i cant find.
14:52 +koush| bcrook: i assume in C++.
14:52 +bcrook| koush: oooh c++. I didnt look there
14:52  xaueious| programming stuff/
14:52  Nauren| can I use a normal mini usb for data on a touch pro2?
14:52 +bcrook| I was looking at the import lines
14:52 +bcrook| Nauren: Should be able to
14:52  dcplaya| Nauren yep  sure can
14:52  xaueious| if it fits i dun't see why not
14:52  Nauren| okay, cool.
14:52  Nauren| thanks you sirs.
14:53  xaueious| um...
14:53  phh| TP2 user, here ?
14:53  dcplaya| anyone have any info on the 5.0.7 pre changelog, specifically this entry "Email signature support from Jarrett Vance"
14:53  xaueious| if i try to build a kernel port
14:53         * BUGabundo waves o/
14:53 +koush| err no its in java, found it.
14:53  xaueious| do i just make mrproper ?
14:53  xaueious| to clean up everything
14:53  Nauren| when building CM what's the dif between userdebug and eng?
14:53  xaueious| i followed instructions
14:53  xaueious| i got my phone to boot
14:53  xaueious| tried to built for EBI0 and failing
14:53  phh| xaueious: unless you do really weird stuff, you don't need mrproper
14:54         * BUGabundo is in love with twicca :)
14:54 +koush|     static final int MAX_RECENT_TASKS = 20;
14:54  xaueious| well i modified the EBI1 line
14:54 +bcrook| koush: There is another file in android_frameworks_policies_base/phone/com/android/internal/policy/impl
14:54 +koush| hrm that looks fine bcrook.
14:54  xaueious| i built first with =y
14:54 @cyanogen| eng does one thing in particular- idisables dex preoptimization which will get your system booting faster (but causes some other weird things to happen)
14:54 +bcrook| koush: Maybe I chose the wrong file to edit?
14:54  xaueious| people getting stuck at boot screen
14:54 +koush| bcrook: nah you got the right file.
14:54  xaueious| i'll probably let smeone else do this
14:54 +bcrook| koush: Its exactly the same file name
14:54 @cyanogen| there are also things that don't get built in userdebug currently
14:55  xaueious| i'll ask later
14:55  Nauren| cyanogen, thank you, good sir.
14:55 +koush| bcrook: oh.
14:55 +koush| bcrook: yeah, lol.
14:55 +bcrook| lol fuck
14:55  phh| xaueious: i'm phhusson from xda, if you have any question concerning the oc patch
14:55 +koush| lmao
14:55  dcplaya| cyanogen  can you tell me what "Email signature support from Jarrett Vance" is gonna do?  Android already supports signatures
14:55 +bcrook| is the mid one not used in eclair or some shit?
14:55  xaueious| i'm pretty noob
14:55  xaueious| i was just trying to build it
14:55  Nauren| 11hz ftw
14:55  xaueious| it works for me actually
14:55 +koush| bcrook: there are different "policies"
14:55 +koush| bcrook: i dont know what mid is
14:55  xaueious| my g1 was running at 614 MHz
14:55 +bcrook| koush: fml
14:55 +koush| bcrook: its for a different type of device
14:55 +koush| bcrook: but the one you want is phone.
14:55 +bcrook| I will change it and try
14:56 +bcrook| LOL
14:56 +koush| bcrook: :)
14:56 +bcrook| cunt
14:56 +koush| hahaha
14:56 +bcrook| thanks man
14:56 +koush| bcrook: i didnt mean that to sound as dickish as it came out :)
14:56  phh| xaueious: still you're the only one who succeeded into using it somehow.
14:56  xaueious| as i said in that thread i had problems booting to even 653 MHz
14:56  xaueious| well no one built it
14:56  xaueious| if someone would just try it
14:56  Chopes| ciwrl: if i use the native sms app, does that redirect through GV though?
14:56  xaueious| even the 711 MHz booted past the boots creen
14:56  Chopes| or am i sending messages through my #
14:56 @cyanogen| it does in gmail
14:56 +bcrook| koush: You arent the cunt. Android is.
14:56  ciwrl| Chopes nope
14:56  Chopes| doh
14:56  xaueious| if they are getting stuck at the boot screen it means that I screwed up the kernel port
14:56  xaueious| and not the patch itself
14:57  Chopes| so i pretty much have to use the GV app to send messages from my GV number?
14:57  phh| xaueious: not sure
14:57  xaueious| i don't have a g1 with EBI0 radio right now
14:57 @cyanogen| but not in the plain email client
14:57  phh| oh well, if 711 got past it for you ...
14:57  xaueious| i can flash it but it's a bit of a pain
14:57  xaueious| it did
14:57  xaueious| but after the screen turns on
14:57  xaueious| it freezes
14:57  EddieRingle| cyanogen: 4.4 soon? :)
14:57  BUGabundo| yep
14:57  xaueious| i think due to it trying to intialize more hardware
14:57  BUGabundo| super secret project
14:57  dcplaya| ah ok, thanks cyanogen  I was thinking (and hoping) that he figured out a way to sync my signature from gmail web app to the phone
14:57  xaueious| and i have to pull battery
14:57 +bcrook| koush: It didnt sound dickish. Thanks for the help
14:57  dcplaya| Chopes  did you just switch to GV?
14:57 +bcrook| im glad what I did in theory was correct
14:58  Chopes| naw, i never tried sending batch messages from it before tho
14:58  xaueious| anyways i'm pretty sure the patch itself is fine
14:58  Chopes| trying to figure out if i just gota deal with it or if there is a workaround
14:58  xaueious| i'll let someone else figure the rest out
14:58  phh| xaueious: it works as is on heroc
14:58  xaueious| ya
14:58  xaueious| i know
14:58  xaueious| too bad
14:58  phh| xaueious: but it's) not impossible that G1's cpu sucks
14:58  phh| I mean, if they released it as 384MHz, it's maybe for a reason
14:59  xaueious| 614 mhz isn't that bad
14:59  xaueious| i'll try again
14:59  xaueious| i actually didn't even wipe
14:59  phh| +15%
14:59  phh| hum
14:59  phh| I'd say it's unnoticeable
14:59  xaueious| i did 711 mhz, booted, froze, battery pull -> 654 mhz, froze, battery pull -> 614 mhz, ran okay :D
14:59 +bcrook| xaueious: What are you trying to do?
14:59  phh| anyway, on wince devices, o/c to 650MHz, is said to change espresso rom from unusable to usable
15:00  phh| but for WVGA devices.
15:00  dcplaya| Chopes there is 1 work around but its a pain in the ass. you have to get the 404 numbers for each contact, the only way to get those are to have them text you and it will show up in the native messaging app
15:00  Chopes| doh
15:00  xaueious| someone with a faster computer should try the different frequeicies. because with me trying to build the thing it is a bit of a pain
15:00  Chopes| forget that, ill wait for an update and just do things manually for now
15:00  Chopes| =/
15:00  Chopes| thanks for the info tho
15:00  xaueious| brcook i'm trying a new oc patch
15:00  xaueious| seems to actually do something :D
15:00 +bcrook| xaueious: Is it a real OC?
15:00  xaueious| ya
15:01 +bcrook| is it kmobsHAT approved?
15:01  xaueious| i can't get it stable on my g1
15:01  dcplaya| no problem Chopes
15:01  xaueious| oh wait
15:01  xaueious| someone just booted :D
15:01  xaueious| lol
15:01  xaueious| maybe i didn't screw it up
15:01  phh| xaueious: god knows how :p

15:03 +bcrook| xaueious: me = nexus
15:03  xaueious| u sold right
15:03 +koush| bcrook: make a expose style recent apps list imo.
15:03  xaueious| -_-
15:03 +koush| bcrook: i have wanted to do that for such a long time but been too damn lazy
15:03 +bcrook| koush: a circle?
15:03 +koush| bcrook: story of my life
15:03 +koush| bcrook: sec let me give you a screenshot of expose.
15:03  xaueious| prices are going down for the magic
15:03  xaueious| shucks
15:04 +bcrook| xaueious: yeah. 275 shipped. no thrilled
15:04  osaeed| i think prash raped me
15:04  xaueious| lol what
15:04  osaeed| im getting itchy in my ass
15:04  osaeed| itchiness*
15:05  mdmadph| that's just hemorrhoids.  Eat more fiber.
15:05  osaeed| ic.. ill just have popcorn tonight
15:05  osaeed| the kernels are better than microwave ones
15:06  osaeed| i hate microwave bags
15:06 +bcrook| i always burn myself
15:06  osaeed| loL!
15:06  xaueious| burn yourself?
15:06 +koush| bcrook: http://koush.romraid.com/Screenshots/skitched-20100420-120429.jpg
15:06  osaeed| like when u open the bag?
15:06 +koush| bcrook: basically it captures the screen of the running task, and shows it
15:06 +koush| bcrook: it might be a little resource intensive though...
15:07  ciwrl| lol at the 'how to capture a OSX screenshot' page
15:07  ciwrl| :p
15:07 +koush| lawl
15:07 +koush| i normally use skitch
15:07 +koush| but skitch cant capture in expose mode
15:07 +bcrook| koush: Yeah. I think a diff layout would be better
15:07  ciwrl| i gotcha, just teasing ;)
15:07  jjcm| dont eat more fiber
15:07 +koush| so i was all "ok how do i do this without a camera and bad lighting"
15:07  jjcm| it's a trap
15:07  jjcm| it'll just make you deficate more
15:07  ciwrl| hahaha
15:07  jjcm| and everyone knows that's sinful
15:08  jjcm| JESUS NEVER POOPED WHY SHOULD YOU?
15:08  osaeed| he never? wow
15:08  osaeed| i have to recheck the books back then
15:08  mdmadph| jesus pooped all the time.
15:09  osaeed| he prob did, but told his followers to write down "jesus never pooped"
15:09  mdmadph| The guy ate nothing but figs and fish, come on.
15:09  dcplaya| speaking of poop... i have to poop badly
15:09  mdmadph| I'm glad cyanogen is not here to see this.
15:09  osaeed| man why did i bring this topic up
15:09  osaeed| fuck me
15:09  dcplaya| yep, ill be back in a few
15:09  mdmadph| That's my favorite KMFDM song.
15:10  xaueious| okay didn't work for them
15:10  xaueious| i have no idea how to build for ebi0
15:10  xaueious| i'll let someone else figure it out
15:10  xaueious| need to study
15:10  xaueious| :D
15:12         -!- kmobsHAT is now known as kmobs
15:12  xaueious| oh well
15:12  xaueious| is there a new cm soon?
15:13  xaueious| with the gif stuff?
15:13  xaueious| or is that in the rom already?
15:13  kep0ne| i think its in there
15:13  Ostebaronen| gif stuff?
15:14  nickbunyun| hey.. how do you guys keep track with your tasks.. or to-do lists?
15:14  niko86| ive got some strange issues with my 32B Magic, i updated to 4.2.15.1 with cm updater, booted fine, now the lock screen is not there anymore.
15:14  osaeed| nickbunyun:  Get AKnotepad
15:14  osaeed| i use that for my tasks and stuff
15:14  osaeed| then i can set an alarm
15:15  Ostebaronen| nickbunyun, remember the milk is also an OK app for that
15:15  Ostebaronen| I just use my brain
15:15  nickbunyun| well i was thinking more of sync`ing web and phone..  RTM is pretty popular... but now with Google Tasks
15:15  Ostebaronen| I keep it there
15:15  niko86| if i press the red button (end call), the screen goes black, i can reactivate the phone with any button, without lockscreen. what happened there?
15:15  mdmadph| nickbunyun: sadly enough, I don't know of a single thing in the known universe that syncs with google Tasks.
15:15  mdmadph| That's just sad.
15:15  ciwrl| niko86 you lost the lcokscreen? reboot and see if its a temp thing..
15:15  mdmadph| You can't even share tasks between accounts.
15:16  niko86| ciwrl: i tried rebooting several times, it did not change anything, i also reflashed cyanogenmod
15:16  nickbunyun| theres a few apps... im trying out GTasks by SSI i believe... they're okay works offline and online.. but i gotta pay for full app to have auto-sync
15:16  ciwrl| niko86 try 'fix_permissions' in terminal, and also clearing the homescreen /cache
15:16  ciwrl| youll lose your icon layouts
15:17 +bcrook| koush: I dont think it worked. I am rebuilding clean now though
15:17  mdmadph| So, I'm going to Verizon in two weeks.  What phone should I get?
15:17  Wasabeh| A good one!
15:17  nickbunyun| get the european locked phone :P
15:18  mdmadph| Yeah, thanks.  Really. :P
15:18 +bcrook| mdmadph: What does Verizon have for Android?
15:18  mdmadph| I think I'll get the... looks at sight Samsung Jazz or some shit
15:19  ciwrl| droid or incredile
15:19  mdmadph| bcrook: the Moto Droid (Milestone), and now the HTC Incredible.
15:19  ciwrl| incredible*
15:19  mdmadph| Also the Droid Eris.
15:19  ciwrl| meh on eris
15:19  mdmadph| Well, and that Motorola Devour.
15:19  mdmadph| Hey, the eris is popular with the ladies.
15:19  ciwrl| droid or incredible
15:19  ciwrl| :)
15:19 +bcrook| agreed ^^^
15:19  niko86| ciwrl: thanks, i am at it, i will report back
15:19  nickbunyun| "droid eris" is one
15:19  mdmadph| Yeah, I'm thinking the Droid -- the hardware keyboard will make it easy to hack with.
15:19  ciwrl| and it runs CM
15:19 +bcrook| mdmadph: i think the milestone is crazy locked down though
15:20  nickbunyun| devour with motoblur.. dude that thing looks square
15:20  nickbunyun| lol
15:20 +bcrook| something about a signed bootloader
15:20  nickbunyun| oh nvm it has a full qwerty keyboard... thumbs up for that
15:20  mdmadph| bcrook: Yeah, the US version isn't, though, oddly enough.  Sucks for the rest of the world. :(
15:20  mdmadph| nickbunyun: The Devour is locked down in the US, though!
15:20  mdmadph| Signed bootloader, even here.
15:20  nickbunyun| where ar eyou from
15:21  Wasabeh| mdmadph: noone outside the US would ever buy a Motorola phone.
15:21  ciwrl| lol +1
15:22  mdmadph| Wasabeh: Anti-USA bias :P
15:22  Wasabeh| ;D
15:22  mdmadph| Weirdly enough, Motorola's Droid and it's marketing have done more to increase the awareness of Android that anything Google ever did
15:22  nickbunyun| where are you from mdmadph
15:22  mdmadph| It's all I hear from laypeople now, "Droid droid droid" instead of "iphone iphone iphone"
15:22  mdmadph| nickbunyun: The southeastern US.
15:22  nickbunyun| and u want to use the devour outside of us?
15:23  plum| i'm fine with "droid droid droid" instead of "iphone iphone iphone" :)
15:23  mdmadph| Nope, inside.  Well, I would, but I'm not getting one. :P
15:23  mdmadph| plum: Oh, hell, me too.
15:23 +bcrook| mdmadph: Oh thats good. Get the milestone then, if it can run koush's CM
15:23  mdmadph| plum: Just weird how everyone now knows what androd is.
15:23 +koush| bcrook: err, i dont know if the milestone is rootable
15:23  ciwrl| yea, but droid =/= android and that irks me when people keep saying, o its a droid....NO mutha-f'er its a nexus
15:23 +koush| bcrook: it requires a signed boot
15:23  mdmadph| bcrook: Yeah, that's what I've been planning!  Just hope it's as easy to root as the G1 was.
15:23 +bcrook| mdmadph: see what koush said
15:24  velazcod| ciwrl LOL +20 !!!
15:24  mdmadph| yeah, that's the international version.
15:24  plum| mdmadph: there are a bunch of android phones now so android is getting good publicity
15:24  nickbunyun| if android could get that smooth browsing from iphone .. would actually be a decent browsing phone.
15:24  plum| i don't credit it to -just- the droid
15:24  mdmadph| ciwrl: Hey, I don't care what people are calling it, as long as they keep buying the phones. ;)
15:24  nickbunyun| web-wise
15:24  ciwrl| lol
15:24  mdmadph| I don't care if they call every Android phone the "Droid"
15:24  ciwrl| the new webkit should improve that
15:24  ciwrl| :)
15:24  Haraken| i just figured out why the nexus one isn't sold in stores, to prevent stuff like this http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/20/thieves-snag-ipad-from-buyer-yank-a-finger-off-while-theyre-at/
15:24  nickbunyun| when is new webkit comin out
15:24 +bcrook| koush: didnt work
15:25 +koush| bcrook: what happed
15:25 +koush| bcrook: what happened*
15:25 +bcrook| koush: fuck. nm
15:25 +bcrook| I am a fucking child
15:25  nickbunyun| Haraken... lmao i dont know whats funnier.. the iphone story or the fact that to that story to the right of it is a Android Ad. hahahaaaa

16:13  stratos| are the drivers for the display closed source, cyanogen?
16:13  stratos| im assuming all drivers for the N1 are
16:13  _Marek_| cyanogen: do you know what's still missing on qualcomm part?
16:13  sd_card_unreadab| ciwrl: then you might want to correct the wiki since it says i'm supposed to use the rooted telnetd and run flash_image recovery /sdcard/cm-recovery-1.4.img
16:13  Wasabeh| Thanks ciwrl and velazcod
16:14  Wasabeh| Since that app was always running, and I don't use it.
16:15  velazcod| yeah, it's bc it detects wifi connections and stuff to resume downloads... use autostarts from the market to deal with those little apps
16:15  velazcod| but be careful with disabling unnecessary shit
16:15  velazcod| v
16:15  velazcod| Wasabeh
16:16  D|3-H4rD| hi all
16:16  niko86| ciwrl: THANKS!! lockscreen is back!
16:16  Wasabeh| velazcod: ok
16:16  niko86| ciwrl: so if someone also experiences this problem, wipe and reflash is the way to got
16:16  underdog`| jbeitler: I imagine you can force the device to not sync with the car dock, and leave it free for your built-in bluetooth in your car.
16:17  ciwrl| ty niko86
16:18  jbeitler| underdog`: that's what I thought.. but the whit pages were very clear about it.. and I have not gotten any word back for their "support emails address"

16:45             muze | hello all
16:45             muze | i have a technical question, if anyone doesn't mind
16:47      Charansingh | muze: continue
16:47             muze | ok
16:47             muze | i need a new sd for my nexus
16:48             muze | and i was wondering if the nexus would be able to take advantage of a class 10 card, and whether i would notice a difference between that and a class 6
16:48             muze | i use the card very heavily day to day
16:48             muze | i know the phone has rediculous nand speeds, but i don't know anything about the sd bus speeds
16:49      Charansingh | muze: i thought of something better LOL.  thats no technical. just buy what u need. nexus will even use class 10 n if u gonna hook it up to pc via card reader prefer class 10, class 6 is enough though
16:50             muze | that's true i didn't think about use with the computer
16:50             muze | thanks
16:50      Charansingh | muze: class10>class6 all depends on ur need.
16:50      Charansingh | class 6 is more than enough for average user
16:50             muze | well yeah i know the difference in speeds, the 10 can write at 10MBps
16:50             muze | but can the phone even do it that fast?
16:52    ViciousCircle | I thought I read somewhere that the Droid at least doesn't even take full advantage of class 6 speeds, but I don't know how accurate that was
16:52         Creeture | My Class 2 Sandisk is a good bit faster than my Class 6 A-Data in my G1.
16:53             muze | Creeture, i know the g1 couldn't write that fast, i started with one, you probly got a good class 2 out of the batch
16:53         Creeture | I think I got a bad Class 6 to be honest.
16:53          Psylink | well that was freaking weird
16:54             muze | that too. that sucks more though.
16:54          Psylink | my n1 starts ringing (my 2yr old calling my phone form my gfs phone) during the ringing, i hear the sound of him pressing keys.  while the phone was ringing
16:55          I-Shawn | Creeture: could be the brand, my sandisk is 4GB R/W @ 8MB/s
16:55      Charansingh | my sandisk ultra II at 20mbps
16:55      Charansingh | 16gb
16:55          I-Shawn | Charansingh: I think I just shit myself a little on that.....
16:56      Charansingh | n i have a Kingston 32gb in n1 class 2
16:56             benx | I have a topram 16gb and that seems more than quick enough
16:56          I-Shawn | Charansingh: wanna buy me one and send it to me?
16:56             muze | Psylink, sometimes that happens to me, it seems like when you try to answer it works, and you conect, but the ringing is just stuck
16:56      Charansingh | i-shawn: i benchmark with card reader n it was the only original i found sorry ;)
16:57          Psylink | no
16:57      Charansingh | going to sleep
16:57          Psylink | i didnt answer, but i was hearing him pressing buttons as if i had answered
16:57         -!- Charansingh is now known as charan|sleep
16:57          Psylink | it was like he was holding the 5 key and i was hearing the tone it would make
16:57             muze | oh, that is weirrd
16:58          I-Shawn | lmao, my niece was sitting up, now she is leaning forward to eat it face first lmao
16:58          Psylink | and it was overtop of the ringtone playing also
16:58          I-Shawn | she was sucking on her toe
16:59            bri3d | Creeture: Class 6 A-Data is just slow
16:59            bri3d | I have one too
16:59            bri3d | it gets exactly 6.0MB/s on a good day with a good reader
17:00            bri3d | they certainly weren't going for overachievement there
17:00            bri3d | I have old pre-SDHC 1GB and 2GB cards that are much faster
17:00           osaeed | Yo satanr1, thanks for fixing the Wiki.
17:01             muze | calling cyanogen? maybe?
17:02             muze | we need like a bat signal

17:38          I-Shawn | they are browser ones that appear
17:38          I-Shawn | download from market and old finished dls from browser pop up as well

17:41             thak | Hello, I have an issue where if I remove my headphones from the Nexus One (or I lose bluetooth connectivity) it will occasionally launch the Music Player application application and start playing music. I am usuing Cyanogen 5.0.6, but it was happening with 5.0.5, never saw it with the regular firmware. Google Listen is normally running when this happens, although it may be paused. When I get to the music player app the button still shows the song as p
17:41             thak | Does anyone have any idea what this might be caused by?

17:42          I-Shawn | thak: its a bitch that wont die
17:42             thak | Cyanogen specific or Android 2.1?
17:42          I-Shawn | thak: cyanogen specific
17:42          I-Shawn | it happened on the Dream/Sappires

17:43            kmobs+| actually on the N1, its not cyanogen specific
17:43        BUGabundo | I-Shawn: its upstream too
17:43           Nauren | oh, no solution?
17:43         Creeture | thak: It happens on CM 4.2 also. Sometimes, when you have Music paused and unplug the headphones, it'll unpause for less than a second and re-pause.
17:43         Creeture | But only when you're not trying to debug it.
17:45          I-Shawn | yeah its so random, you can't recreate it to debug it
17:49             thak | Hrm... this seems to imply it isn't Cyanogen specific, thanks for the link!

Thanks.
13:06        thedudeTM | synergy plus is a maintenance fork of synergy2
13:06        thedudeTM | i can't remember when i didn't use synergy

13:08        waitforit | i barely have time to work on my main app, or i would look into it
13:09        thedudeTM | ha

13:38        dotnetted | bri3d: http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/index.php/Building_from_source - I followed them to the letter and 'sed -n -e "s/^add_lunch_combo//gp" vendor/*/vendorsetup.sh' doesn't show anything CM
13:39        thedudeTM | stratos, lemme look
13:40        thedudeTM | stratos ridata
13:40          stratos | sweet
13:40        dotnetted | I've got the kernel in /labs/cyanogenmod/cm-kernel/arch/arm/boot/zImage and the android repo in /labs/android-source
13:40          stratos | thanks thedudeTM
13:40     Sucalakafufu | anyone have any idea about whats up with my gmail problem?
13:41        thedudeTM | Sucalakafufu: i don't even know what it is
13:41          stratos | thedudeTM: is there a catch with app2SD when it comes to upgrading CM?
13:41          stratos | or wiping?
13:42        thedudeTM | nah
13:42          stratos | like if i wipe and install latest CM, how do the apps get put back into CM?
13:42        thedudeTM | if the apps are on ext2 they will get mounted to /sd-ext
13:42        thedudeTM | unless you wipe ext2
13:42        thedudeTM | it's magic
13:42        thedudeTM | and not like that apple magic, this is real magic
13:42            bri3d | dotnetted: are you sure you grabbed repo from cyanogen's github
13:42            bri3d | http://github.com/cyanogen/android_vendor_cyanogen/blob/donut/vendorsetup.sh
13:42            bri3d | you should see cyanogen_dream_us-eng
13:43            bri3d | if you're synced with CM github donut branch properly
13:43     Sucalakafufu | thedudeTM: so i get gmail notifications normally. but im not able to send or update my gmail from my phone
13:43     Sucalakafufu | even deleting doesnt sync
13:43     Sucalakafufu | i've already run fix_permissions
13:43        thedudeTM | uhhh not without logs
13:43     Sucalakafufu | alright. will be awhile before i can get those
13:43        thedudeTM | fix_permissions shouldn't matter with googly bits
13:43     Sucalakafufu | thats what i thought
13:44     Sucalakafufu | just ran it to be safe
13:44        thedudeTM | i need to see what lolcat is saying when you try a manual sync
13:44     Sucalakafufu | alright ill do that when i get out of classes
13:44          stratos | thedudeTM: lol
13:45        dotnetted | Looks like the Wiki skips a step heh - once you get to 'Build CyanogenMod' you won't be ready
13:46        dotnetted | I'm reading through 'Building for Passion/Nexus One' below that which seems to make more sense - Ill try it out now
13:46        thedudeTM | wait
13:46        thedudeTM | Sucalakafufu: i can't help you actually

13:48   thedude|werkin | rayosx: you fixed it
13:48           rayosx | the dude, thanks man :) this is my frist time here
13:49    QaeadarDAzeal | Didn't think so. I've tried to to do a logcat, but they're random.
13:49           rayosx | guys, I have a G1 and the cyanogen mod 4.2.15.1   My phone drains a lot of battery, I don't know if that is normal with this OS version or not
13:50        waitforit | the G1 battery life just isnt very good... at least for me
13:53           rayosx | waitforit, I understand that, but my phone was not acting like that before
13:53           rayosx | not the next day is off
13:53           rayosx | for instance I leave it with battery
13:53           rayosx | and in the morning is off
13:53           rayosx | that happens all days
13:53            bri3d | rayosx: I think everyone with a G1 eventually gets this issue
13:53          stratos | what comes with the N1?
13:53          stratos | the micro sd
13:53            bri3d | it wears out batteries pretty fast
13:53          stratos | is it a class 2?
13:53     Sucalakafufu | thedude|werkin: :( lol
13:53       PsychoI3oy@| rayosx, http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/index.php/Troubleshooting#Battery_recalibration
13:54       PsychoI3oy@| give that a shot
13:54           rayosx | bri3d, next day if you leave it on suspend or how do you call it?  hm...   just there,   next day is off ?
13:54       PsychoI3oy@| should be SOP for any sudden changes of battery life
13:54           rayosx | psychoi3toy, do you think that can fix the problem ? it was not acting like that before
13:54   thedude|werkin | rayosx: definitely do what PsychoI3oy says
13:54   thedude|werkin | it won't hurt
13:54           rayosx | perfect dudes
13:54            bri3d | rayosx: there's no reason not to try what PsychoI3oy says
13:54         *     PsychoI3oy has never been called psychotoy before
13:54           rayosx | I will give it a try :)
13:55            bri3d | rayosx: and yeah, friend's G1 did that after about 9 months
13:55           rayosx | thanks for all the help ! ! !  ! ! !!  ! ! !
13:55            bri3d | tried all the calibration stuff
13:55   thedude|werkin | PsychoI3oy is my psychotoy
13:55            bri3d | and ended up needing a new battery
13:55            bri3d | so it happens sometimes
13:55           rayosx | I will do it ! :) lalalalalala dum da dum da dum

14:28   EddieRingle-G1 | I heard there were still some media issues
14:28            kmobs+| there are, but everything else works 100% and the build is fast
14:28   EddieRingle-G1 | cool
14:28      BlackBishop | faster than the current 4.2 ?
14:28       Bumble-Bee | ohhh souns sexy :P
14:29            kmobs+| I think its about the same speed.  I test it on my roommate's g1 and he says that its faster than 4.2 was

14:29   EddieRingle-G1 | nice
14:29      BlackBishop | well .. will wait and see then :)
14:30      BlackBishop | but we NEED camera
14:30          stratos | why not setup a ROM benchmark
14:30          stratos | someone should program that
14:30          stratos | just a linpack type program that tests overall speed of the OS or some shit
14:30          stratos | some series of metrics that would work universally

14:30            kmobs+| stratos: because thats not possible

14:31          stratos | kmobs: why not?
14:32            kmobs+| because its so arbitrary
14:33          stratos | it just seems like someone could make a suite of tools into one app that would run and give you an overall metric of speed/performance
14:34          stratos | kind of like how windows does it, though i have no idea how accurate that number is

15:13          Haraken | wpw
15:13          Haraken | wow
15:13         Wanderer | is there a way I can load Cyanogenmod cleanly and if it doesn't work or I don't like it, simply flip back to Droidmod?
15:14         neatchee | Wanderer: nandroid backup
15:14     clarkeismine | nandroid
15:14          Haraken | I just put my original battery back in my g1, I had forgotten how small this phone was without the extended battery
15:14         jbeitler | did everyone see this? --> http://www.androidcentral.com/have-t-mobile-nexus-one-youre-your-own-further-3g-fixes
15:14    thedude|FIRES | droooooooid
15:14     clarkeismine | jbeitler: it is probably a tmob/hardware issue
15:15         -!- kmobsHAT is now known as kmobs
15:15     clarkeismine | jbeitler: so they are not wasting more resources atm
15:15       MrUrbanity | so glad i went AT&T for my N1 .. i was already having issues with tm coverage on a normal device.
15:15       MrUrbanity | it's a tmob issue for sure, their network blows.
15:15     clarkeismine | jbeitler: I would like to point out "at this time"
15:15     clarkeismine | MrUrbanity: well there are similar 3g issues reported by ATT folks
15:16     clarkeismine | MrUrbanity: so I think it might be a design error for the GSM N1 folks...
15:16         jbeitler | oh i saw that clarkeismine I was just passing information on
15:16     clarkeismine | I am stoked about Tmob in my area of SC
15:16       MrUrbanity | i dont think it's hardware, i think it's mostly network .. i think the hardware fixes they have done so far have fixed quite a bit, whats left is network related mostly.. not all.. but mostly.
15:17     clarkeismine | ATT just moved / replaced a bunch of towers in Upstate SC and such... so Tmob bought them all
15:17         jbeitler | i have not had any issues with mine.. other than when we were in a cave 1700 feet below the ground.. so I cant get mad about it not working there
15:17     clarkeismine | Tmob just bought like 150 towers in my area from ATT
15:17     clarkeismine | jbeitler: yeah... I don't have issues with Tmob either
15:17             plum | just played around with an ipad, my department got one for help support...
15:18     clarkeismine | I want one of those adam pads
15:18         Wanderer | hmm,  I turned off my phone then held the power button and the home button, it booted normally
15:18     clarkeismine | with the hybrid lcd e-ink screens
15:18         neatchee | clarkeismine: they're not hybrid
15:18         neatchee | you have to pick one
15:18       MrUrbanity | my wife can't get even a normal Tmob signal in our house, but the 3G on my nook works great.. so i knew we had to go ATT .. she got iphone i got n1.
15:18           UX-Guy | so 2.1 flavored CM coming to g1's and mt3g now that the accellerated video is in place?

15:41          stratos | i didnt ask when!

15:41             zinx | stratos: yes
15:41          stratos | i just wanted to know if the N1 was capable of doing hardware accelerated anything
15:41          stratos | gaming/video playback
15:41         cyanogen@| oh
15:41            Assid | question would be price then

15:42            Assid | i wanna buy a g1 :(
15:42          stratos | seems liek the drivers are fucked on everything in the N1
15:42             zinx | stratos: on the N1, sure
15:42             zinx | stratos: until recently the Eclair stuff didn't have working drivers for the G1

15:43            Assid | err when i relicablirate
15:43            Assid | should i restart hte phone after the system shuts its self down
15:43            Assid | it normally shuts down at 5%
15:44             zinx | lexs: no, that's how much more i need for a N1
15:44             zinx | lexs: :P
15:44             lexs | zinx: i have a N1 in the mail :c
15:44             zinx | lexs: "Google" (Brightstar) still charges $400 + Shipping, though, and T-Mobile still charges $380
15:44             lexs | google isn't even selling the g1 anymore
15:45             zinx | you can get them used for ~$150
15:45             lexs | brightstar (i think) has mine in a warehouse somewhere
15:45            Assid | quick question on recalibrating batteries
15:46            Assid | should i restart the phone after the initial shutdown @5%
15:46            Assid | so it kills the battery further

16:06      Ostebaronen | yeah, build them for the phone as an android app :D
16:06      Ostebaronen | or wait..
16:06      Ostebaronen | X_D
16:06      Ostebaronen | maybe not
16:07      Ostebaronen | I think there is something called jbed
16:07      Ostebaronen | if you want to play with java apps
16:07           IVBela | yea, i found jbed too, but it doesn't seem to work on 2.1
16:07           IVBela | at least not the one i found
16:08      Ostebaronen | I dunno then
16:08        DarkFoxDK | It doesn't.. I use the one from Acer Liquid
16:08      Ostebaronen | what do you want to run on it?
16:08        DarkFoxDK | libjbmidp
16:08           IVBela | that's why i'm asking here... hoping i'm not the only one needing this
16:09         jbeitler | when are they going to fix bluetooth? its not a real question unless you have a real answer
16:09           IVBela | Ostebaronen: there's a java app one can use to buy bus tickets on a phone here, i need that for my android device
16:09      Ostebaronen | IVBela, OH, OK
16:09           IVBela | DarkFoxDK: i'll check that one! it works on nexus?
16:09        DarkFoxDK | I have no idea
16:09        DarkFoxDK | I have a G1
16:10           IVBela | :)
16:10           IVBela | anyway, thanks for the idea!
16:10         *         IVBela looks around the web
16:11      Ostebaronen | yeah I am looking as well
16:15           IVBela | DarkFoxDK: how do you launch a .java file after installing this jbed?
16:15           IVBela | just by starting it via any file manager?
16:15        DarkFoxDK | is it a .java or .jad/.jar?
16:15           IVBela | .jar
16:16        DarkFoxDK | Hm...
16:16           IVBela | if i remember correctly :)
16:16        DarkFoxDK | I think you need to go into the "Java ME apps" and then click install or something.
16:17           IVBela | ok
16:17           IVBela | thanks, i give it a try

10:36           Nauren | if I get a key from gamestop do I get an invite?
10:36      BlackBishop | hmmm .. www.starcraft2.com doesn't work for me
10:36     Levinax|work | try blizzard.com
10:36            kmobs+| Nauren: when you preorder the game, they send you a key
10:37     Levinax|work | or battle.net
10:37      BlackBishop | works now ..
10:37      BlackBishop | :/
10:37            kmobs+| Levinax|work: I just dislike gamestop, I'd rather wait and get a key through other methods
10:37           Nauren | kmobs, they also let everyone with a key have one invite
10:38           Nauren | I was wondering if I would get the invite.
10:38            kmobs+| Nauren: oooh, its not isntant

10:38           Nauren | because, while I hate gamestop, I feel that them sucking shouldn't negatively impact my life any more than it has to

10:52     Levinax|work | sad
10:52              SuD | N1 has N (at least in the name)
10:53             infz | if the droid has the broadcomm bluetooth chip, it's possible that it also has fm capability
10:53             infz | pretty much every new broadcomm bt-chip has fm capability, it's just been disabled
10:53             infz | like in N1 and in iPhone for example
10:55         |Jason8| | android 2.2 ftw!
10:57      BlackBishop | infz: hardware or software disabled ?!

10:58     dasunsrule32 | Sweet! In lala land
10:59     Levinax|work | so the bluetooth / wifi chip in the droid is unmarked... so no one knows what it is?
10:59 BUGabundo_remote | dasunsrule32: when its ready
10:59       chaddledee | What does the new broadcom driver do if the N1 already had Wireless N?
10:59     dasunsrule32 | heh
10:59     dasunsrule32 | I can't help it, get really excited about new releases :-p
11:00 BUGabundo_remote | me too
11:00 BUGabundo_remote | almost pee myself
11:01      BlackBishop | get a better OB
11:02     Levinax|work | i found a thing that says the wifi/bluetooth chip in the droid is from TI, not broadcom
11:02 BUGabundo_remote | cyanogenOB... for your protection
11:03      BlackBishop | no, iptables is for my protection !

11:17       chaddledee | It's not at all locked down at all
11:17          stratos | so i could go to ATT?
11:17          stratos | but not VZQ or SPRINT

11:17          stratos | ...
11:17          stratos | awesome
11:17            prash@| you COULD but get 2g, OR you can exchange your tmo n1 for att n1

11:17          stratos | who does that

11:18          stratos | lol
11:18            prash@| pay some restocking fee and get the att one
11:18       chaddledee | tmo N1 is teh release one, right?
11:18       chaddledee | Cos that one works in the rest of the world
11:19       chaddledee | It should work on every provider outside of America, with 3G
11:19            Ardin | uh
11:19            Ardin | no
11:19       chaddledee | Uh, yes.
11:19            Ardin | ATT phones work outside america with 3G
11:19            Ardin | Tmobile does not
11:19       chaddledee | Yeah
11:19       chaddledee | ATT is also GSM
11:19       chaddledee | Wait
11:19            Ardin | .. as is tmobile.
11:20            Ardin | tmobile uses a nonstandard 3G frequency
11:20       chaddledee | Why does Tmobile phones not work with ATT 3G?
11:20       chaddledee | Well
11:20           bcrook+| diff. frequencies
11:20       chaddledee | My N1 gets 3G
11:20       chaddledee | and I live in UK
11:20       chaddledee | and it was a launch one
11:20       chaddledee | Which is the same as teh Tmo one
11:20           bcrook+| cause your frequencies match
11:21    Levinax|Droid | Someone needs to activate the FM transmitter on the Droid...
11:21       chaddledee | But all frequencies in the UK match
11:21       chaddledee | and hte rest of Europe as well
11:21            kmobs+| I feel sorry for whoever has a droid
11:21       chaddledee | So either Tmo or ATT will work here in EU
11:21       chaddledee | Not both
11:22       chaddledee | And it should be Tmo
11:22           bcrook+| chaddledee: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UMTS_frequency_bands
11:22       chaddledee | Because hte Tmo N1 works with 3G here
11:23       chaddledee | Yeah
11:23       chaddledee | bcrooks, I get that
11:23       chaddledee | It's just if Tmo N1 doesn't work on ATT 3G
11:23       chaddledee | but it does work on EU 3G
11:23       chaddledee | Then ATT 3G bands must be different to EU ones
11:24       chaddledee | Time for some L4D2
11:26          blunden | only the Tmobile N1 works in europe
11:26          blunden | ATT probably works in Canada though
11:26         |Jason8| | the ATT one would work in canada
11:26         |Jason8| | it doesn't have euro 3G bands?
11:26         |Jason8| | wtf
11:27          blunden | |Jason8|: no, because Canada is as non-standard as the US
11:27         |Jason8| | no
11:27          blunden | the Tmobile works though
11:27         |Jason8| | it's 850/1900 for US/Canada 3G
11:27         |Jason8| | it's north america
11:28          blunden | |Jason8|: yeah, unlike most of the rest of the world
11:28         |Jason8| | but normally HTC's US 3G phones have 2100 as well

11:30           bcrook+| Canada is very fucked up
11:30          blunden | if they would normal there would be none of that "I want this or that phone on that carrier"
11:31          blunden | it would just be to buy a new sim and switch
11:31          blunden | or rather get a new sim for free
11:33         slyboots | right, I think thats the CC card sorted out.. :P
11:34         slyboots | Should be getting my Google phone.. Uh.. .. Soon?(ish..)
11:36     Levinax|work | so here's a question: if the droid does indeed contain a Texas Instruments wifi/bt/fm transmitter/receiver chip like iSuppli says it does... how hard would it be to write something to utilize it?
11:36             infz | i think it requires new radio code to be enabled
11:37     Levinax|work | so... very hard then?
11:37           bcrook+| yes
11:37     Levinax|work | like writing a whole new driver?
11:38           bcrook+| i would think so
11:38           bcrook+| the software is probably closed source too
11:40         slyboots | Plus it may not actually be enabled on chip
11:41         -!- thedood|away is now known as thedudeTM
11:41             infz | it's propably only been disabled by software

11:42        thedudeTM | no one is being worked on
11:42             infz | :P
11:42        thedudeTM | but there is a big nasty wall in the way..but you'll be happy when it's done.

12:10             zinx | you can update it from the phone
12:10             infz | just flash it using fastboot
12:10          blunden | yeah, flash_image or fastboot should do it
12:10             zinx | either by using flash_image or if you have an engineering hboot, fastboot
12:10             zinx | fastboot needs a computermachine :/

13:16         slyboots | Odd, I cant adb shell into my phone
13:16             zinx | i have like 5 checkouts of various branches :E
13:16         slyboots | Its showing up on device manager as a Android ADB interface, but adb just shows Device not found
13:17           audist | Boldfilter: I bought a mt3g with CM preinstalled, and I've been trying to update it
13:17             zinx | Boldfilter: most people in here have rooted phones already, and the few that don't usually have them a few minutes after joinnig :P
13:17           audist | Any way I can get root?
13:17             zinx | audist: can you try using CM Updater?
13:17             zinx | audist: what version of CM is it?
13:18       Boldfilter | member:audist: failed to copy 'DRC83_base_defanged.zip' to '/root/DRC83_base_defanged.zip': Read-only file system
13:18       Boldfilter | figured no root
13:19           audist | zinx: 4.2.13
13:19             zinx | Boldfilter: he's doing it wrong
13:19             zinx | audist: use CM updater
13:19       PsychoI3oy@| O_o
13:19       PsychoI3oy@| does /root even exist on Android?
13:19         slyboots | Right, Making a Nandroid backup
13:19           audist | zinx: okay
13:19             zinx | PsychoI3oy: no
13:19       PsychoI3oy@| heh, yes
13:20             zinx | oh?
13:20             zinx | it's not what you think :P
13:20             zinx | i.e., not ~root
13:20       PsychoI3oy@| right
13:20       Boldfilter | isnt /root ..... /
13:20             zinx | Boldfilter: no
13:20       PsychoI3oy@| it's probably just a dir inside rootfs
13:20       PsychoI3oy@| Boldfilter, no, /root is the homedir for the admin user on 'nix, aka 'root'
13:21       PsychoI3oy@| the root of the filesystem(s) is /
13:21       Boldfilter | yeah /
13:21       PsychoI3oy@| but on Android, / is not really a directory
13:21        waitforit | i want root beer now
13:21       PsychoI3oy@| it's 'rootfs' which is a compressed filesystem image that's always read-only
13:22       PsychoI3oy@| only 'real' directories off that are /cache, /data, and /system
13:22       Boldfilter | oh yeah the imgs
13:23       PsychoI3oy@| so not being able to put the defanged base on / or /root is normal and expected
13:23       Boldfilter | interesting
13:23       PsychoI3oy@| (oh yeah /sdcard is a real dir too, obviously)
13:23       PsychoI3oy@| and the place that update.zip type files should go for flashing from recovery
13:23           audist | zinx: eh, one last newb question but how do you get CM updater to work?
13:23       PsychoI3oy@| not that I've been paying attention as to why the files aren't going there
13:23             zinx | audist: you install it
13:24             zinx | audist: then you click the buttons that say they do what you want them to do
13:24             zinx | audist: be sure to allow it to run commands if you get asked
13:24           audist | zinx: install it, how?
13:24             zinx | uhm
13:24             zinx | by going to the market, searching for it, and clicking install
13:25         slyboots | Okay, So ...  Where do I get this USerdata.img file from?
13:25         slyboots | Or is it just data.img?
13:25       Boldfilter | So if I wanted to update.zip something in data
13:25             zinx | slyboots: nandroid may call it data.img
13:25       Boldfilter | what would be the update command for that
13:25         slyboots | Okay, So now I wipe.. Install 1.6.. latest Cyanogen
13:25             zinx | Boldfilter: dmu
13:25             zinx | erh
13:25             zinx | Boldfilter: mu
13:25         slyboots | Then flash data.img?
13:26          stratos | Writing A Letter To Congress on Salvia
13:26             zinx | Boldfilter: please restate your question :/
13:26          stratos | http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JPfnJVEr8E
13:26       Boldfilter | hold on
13:26       Bumble-Bee | ello
13:27       PsychoI3oy@| audist, search the market for 'cyanogen' and you'll find the updater by 'steve kondik'
13:27         slyboots | So, whats the latest Cyanogen for the G1?
13:27           audist | zinx: found it, downloading, but com.process.google.gapps just closed
13:27         slyboots | the newer ones seem to be N1 / Droid only
13:27             zinx | audist: o_O
13:27       PsychoI3oy@| slyboots, still 4.2.15.1 like the topic says
13:27       Boldfilter | copy_dir PACKAGE:Data/App DATA:app?
13:27           audist | I can just download it then move it to my SD card, and have the phone install it?
13:28             zinx | audist: try again.. you may consider wiping at some point or uninstalling the app that's eating all your memory and/or killing processes
13:28             zinx | audist: you can with a file browser, or via adb
13:28             zinx | with adb, you don't even need to put it on the sdcard
13:28       PsychoI3oy@| Boldfilter, wtf are you on about?
13:28       Boldfilter | update script
13:28             zinx | but you have to set adb up to use adb :/
13:28          blunden | slyboots: read the topic of the channel
13:28           audist | i have adb
13:29        underdog` | Does anyone with an N1 have issues with the radio flapping between UMTS and HDSPA constantly?
13:29         slyboots | Diod, downloading it..
13:29             zinx | Boldfilter: you want to create your own update.zip that puts files in /data?
13:29       Boldfilter | YES
13:29         *     PsychoI3oy reiterates his previous O_o
13:29             zinx | Boldfilter: any particular reason?
13:29       PsychoI3oy@| Boldfilter, why not just fastboot flash userdata data.img ?
13:29       Boldfilter | well, for distribution purposes
13:30             zinx | Boldfilter: o_O
13:30         slyboots | well this is going to be fun :D
13:30        waitforit | o_O
13:30       PsychoI3oy@| ohnoes zinx caught the eyebrow thing!
13:30       PsychoI3oy@| waitforit too!
13:30       PsychoI3oy@| omg it's spreading!!!
13:30        waitforit | its like yawning
13:30          blunden | underdog`: not any more than any other phone if I'm somewhere where the coverage is bad
13:30          blunden | with good coverage it's flawless
13:30       PsychoI3oy@| in other news: it's snowing outside
13:30             zinx | PsychoI3oy: i've been doing that forever :/
13:30       Boldfilter | ugh
13:30        waitforit | snowing?
13:31       PsychoI3oy@| actually i think it's a snow/rain mix
13:31             zinx | PsychoI3oy: some day you will catch the 'E' emote :E
13:31       PsychoI3oy@| been raining all night
13:31       PsychoI3oy@| zinx, vampire?
13:31       Bumble-Bee | kmobs u about ? iv beed looking into the wifi N stuff
13:31        waitforit | what area do you live in PsychoI3oy?
13:31       PsychoI3oy@| Denver, CO
13:31             zinx | PsychoI3oy: no idea.  :P
13:31       Boldfilter | copy_dir PACKAGE:system/framework SYSTEM:framework
13:31        waitforit | PsychoI3oy, didnt think it snowed this late in the year there
13:31       Boldfilter | this workd for framework
13:31       PsychoI3oy@| it happens
13:32             zinx | PsychoI3oy: google talk on Android has o_O :D
13:32        waitforit | someone broke the weather
13:32         *      waitforit looks for al gore
13:32          ivanmmj | Has anyone tried running 528mhz on the dream with a VDD of 6 instead of 7? Was it unstable?
13:32         *     PsychoI3oy hasn't actually used gtalk other than making market work
13:32             zinx | PsychoI3oy: i use it instead of IMs
13:32       PsychoI3oy@| waitforit, no kidding, right? it's melting as soon as it hits the ground (here) but I think it's sticking in the foothills
13:32        waitforit | i use gtalk so my cant tell if im at my desk or outside
13:33        waitforit | my boss*
13:33       PsychoI3oy@| haha
13:33             zinx | Boldfilter: you have to ensure DATA: is mounted
13:33             zinx | Boldfilter: and copy to DATA:
13:33           audist | ehh.
13:33             zinx | Boldfilter: note that it's all case sensitive
13:33           audist | process cmupdaterapp.ui has stopped unexpectedly
13:34             zinx | audist: man, your phone is b0rked
13:34       Boldfilter | zinx: allright
13:34           audist | you think so, yeah?
13:34       Boldfilter | so I need a mount DATA command
13:34             zinx | audist: you might want to just wipe and reinstall
13:34           audist | alright
13:34       PsychoI3oy@| odd how the 'port of sacramento' looks like Long Beach harbor
13:35             zinx | audist: people here can help you w/ that (but not me right now), but you'll have to let them know which recovery image you have once you get to recovery mode
13:35         *     PsychoI3oy has trouble imagining a cargo container that far up the Sacramento River
13:35       PsychoI3oy@| much less a whole ship of them
13:35       Bumble-Bee | humm the N1 wifi chip does infact have dule band N capabilitys ... why itsonly working on single band
13:35        waitforit | pirates PsychoI3oy?
13:35       Bumble-Bee | is another matter
13:35       PsychoI3oy@| waitforit, last night's Mentalist
13:35       PsychoI3oy@| set in Sacramento, filmed in LA (like everything)
13:36        waitforit | could be worse, set in la and filmed in vancouver or new zealand
13:36         *     PsychoI3oy born/raised just north of San Francisco and knows how to tell the difference between northern california and southern
13:36       PsychoI3oy@| waitforit, LA's actually easier to pass off
13:36       PsychoI3oy@| erm, copy
13:36       PsychoI3oy@| something
13:36              SuD | 802.11N is an attempt to workaround the fact that 2.4GHz free band is too narrow. And the result is more interference on all channels at the same time
13:37       PsychoI3oy@| Trauma's actually filmed in SF, interestingly enough
13:37        waitforit | I've only been there a few times, not eager to go back
13:37       PsychoI3oy@| Journeyman wasn't, and it was quite obvious
13:37           audist | yeah, zinx. thanks for all of the help
13:37       PsychoI3oy@| though Trauma has way too many shots of the helo flying over bridges
13:37       PsychoI3oy@| if you're in SF going to somewhere else in SF, you don't fly over any bridges
13:38        waitforit | hehe
13:38             zinx | PsychoI3oy: but they look cool!
13:38       Bumble-Bee | SuD but the chip on N1 definatly supports the 2.4 and 5 bands
13:38       PsychoI3oy@| that they do
13:38             zinx | PsychoI3oy: just like cars exploding when you shoot the engine
13:38       PsychoI3oy@| or tanker trucks
13:38             zinx | or propane tanks
13:38        waitforit | and people flying across the room when getting shot
13:38          Loonacy | Cars explode if they hit something too hard.
13:39        waitforit | Loonacy, only Fords
13:39             zinx | Loonacy: of course they do.  i saw it in a movie.e
13:39       PsychoI3oy@| actually those are some of the more realistic explosions, big flaming fireballs; everything else (hand grenades, c4, dynamite, etc) shouldn't have big flaming fireballs but does on TV
13:39              SuD | cars must explode when get out the road, hit anything (only when driven by the bad guys)
13:39            Assid | http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqBDBVK9UyU
13:39              SuD | as seen on Top Secret (the movie)
13:39         *     PsychoI3oy wonders if referencing mythbusters about such things is like referencing wikipedia
13:39        waitforit | danm good movie
13:40             zinx | PsychoI3oy: they would be realistic explosions if there were something strong enough to ignite the gasoline
13:40       PsychoI3oy@| anywho, what little 'docks' there are in Sacramento are all barges n crap
13:40        waitforit | PsychoI3oy, you dont need to. come to texas and you can blow all that up yourself and take notes
13:40       PsychoI3oy@| waitforit, brb texas
13:40             zinx | PsychoI3oy: and something to vaporize it
13:40          Loonacy | I never really understood the problem people have with referencing Wikipedia.  As long as the wiki entry has proper references what's the big deal?
13:40             zinx | PsychoI3oy: gasoline doesn't burn very well without plenty of oxygen available, which it isn't when it's in a container :/
13:40        waitforit | Loonacy, its hip to hate on wikipedia now
13:41       PsychoI3oy@| Loonacy, wikipedia's not referenceable but it's a damn good way to find references that are, heh
13:41       PsychoI3oy@| zinx, I know
13:41            Jubei | if anybody has any experience with disassembling/smali plx drop me a line. thanks
13:41       PsychoI3oy@| and there needs to be really significant dispersion of said gas/air mixture for the fireball to be big badaboom
13:41             zinx | Jubei: #smali
13:42            Jubei | zinx: thx already there but low activity
13:42       PsychoI3oy@| there's a channel for that?
13:42       PsychoI3oy@| wow
13:42        waitforit | PsychoI3oy, i think its easy to say that if you saw it in a michael bay movie, its impossible
13:42             zinx | an official channel, no less
13:42       PsychoI3oy@| waitforit, heh
13:43         slyboots | hm
13:43         slyboots | Im.. really not shore how this is supposed to work..
13:44           audist | Can anyone walk me through a wipe?
13:44         slyboots | I have t wipe and install 1.6 which is going to screw up and wipe my ext partiton
13:44         slyboots | So.. how is the recovery going to help.. ?
13:45         slyboots | Or will the 1.6 not touch the ext partition on the SDcard?
13:45           Eugiaz | I'm using the last nightly build... i activated wifi and gave iwconfig in terminal and i got I hard reboot..
13:45           Eugiaz | something wrong?
13:45        waitforit | brb
13:45       Bumble-Bee | Eugiaz prob a bug ,,,, does it do it every time ?
13:46         slyboots | Or is there way I can just install the 1.6 System.img
13:46         slyboots | Since thats all I need (and not wipe recovery and everything else)
13:46       Bumble-Bee | flashing 1.6 wont touch SD card ...
13:46       Bumble-Bee | -- ext SD
13:46         slyboots | Aye but it'll wipe the recovery partition
13:46         slyboots | I just.. have to wipe 1.6 System.img,
13:46         slyboots | Sorry, Flash 1.6 system.img
13:46       Bumble-Bee | use fastbook
13:46       Bumble-Bee | -- fast boot
13:47         slyboots | not dont htat in a while..
13:47           Eugiaz | Bumble-Bee: I tryed two tymes and  it did it both
13:47       PsychoI3oy@| slyboots, use the defanged base on the wiki 'latest version' page
13:47       PsychoI3oy@| it won't recovery raep
13:47       Bumble-Bee | hummm reflash see what happs
13:48         slyboots | PsychoI3oy: the NAND on my phone is kinda fubared
13:48       Bumble-Bee | slyboots how so ?
13:49         slyboots | if I try to update without wiping and reflashing 1.6 it fails to boot (I/O errors during write)
13:49         slyboots | (Fuck you very much eBay)
13:49           Eugiaz | Bumble-Bee: if I give iwconfig on PC's terminal after adb shell it works fine
13:49       Bumble-Bee | just grab the system.img form the zip on CM wiki and fastboot flash system system.img
13:49       Bumble-Bee | thats really strange Eugiaz
13:50         slyboots | Is that the same as the HTC recovery ?
13:50         slyboots | Since I already have that
13:50       Bumble-Bee | no its not the recovery its the system
13:51         slyboots | I mean is it the same system.img from the HTC recovery image
13:51         slyboots | (Base 1.6 system)
13:51       Bumble-Bee | yes
13:51         slyboots | Okay already got it then
13:51       Bumble-Bee | flash that then CM latest (dot let it boot to stock 1.6 thi)
13:51       Bumble-Bee | --tho

13:52           audist | is there a guide to a full wipe and recovery afterwards somewhere?
13:53         slyboots | Okay, so fastboot flash system filenamge.img?
13:53           Eugiaz | Bumble-Bee: ah ok I found out, probably it's a bug of better terminal app, if you give iwconfig without su it reboots
13:54       Bumble-Bee | ahh thst would explain it
13:55              SuD | http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dSHOnJ04Vc&feature=related <-- At 4:00 (The truth about car explosions :D )

14:03     silverrocker | (i've used cyanogenupdater once maybe it want's me to update using that image?)
14:03        poorolgil | G1?
14:03     silverrocker | yeah
14:04        poorolgil | There's a new cyanogenmod?
14:04     silverrocker | no I don't think so
14:04     silverrocker | I just reset my phone because the home button wasn't wokring.... (same goes for the call button)
14:05        poorolgil | Are you using 4.2.15.1?
14:05     silverrocker | I was using the latest
14:05     silverrocker | but then my home button stopped working
14:05     silverrocker | and now I used the recover to backup
14:05          fknecht | I can't backup my data partition anymore with nandroid, because the yaffs2 driver says: "yaffs tragedy: Bad object type, 1 != 3, for object 2126 at chunk 15777 during scan" and nandroid just keeps writing until the sdcard is full
14:05     silverrocker | and now I'm at stock 1.0
14:05          fknecht | any idea how I can fix that yaffs2 partition without wiping?
14:06        poorolgil | Do your buttons work now?
14:06     silverrocker | yes
14:07     silverrocker | poorolgirl: I googled the problem and fora sugjested to do a wipe and then install cyanogen again
14:07        poorolgil | And now you want to go back to 4.2.15.1?
14:07     silverrocker | yes!
14:07     silverrocker | I want my spicy cyanogen back :(
14:08        poorolgil | Haha why don't you install it the same way you did the first time
14:09     silverrocker | poorolgil: because I totaly forgot how, I used that one wiki page that explained it from making a coldcard up to the point that you have everything running.... but I was wondering if I could do it like with the green recovery console somehow much faster this time
14:09     silverrocker | ?
14:09        poorolgil | Ahh
14:10     silverrocker | (i'm short on time atm but I need my phone to work properly!)
14:10        poorolgil | I do not know sorry
14:10        poorolgil | Id wait for the new cyanogenmod that should come out soon
14:11     silverrocker | damn can't I just use the cyanogen update zip from the downloads section?
14:12     silverrocker | will the new cyanogen also be for the g1?
14:12        poorolgil | Ask cyanogen?
14:12     silverrocker | cyanogen: Will the new cyanogenmod also be for the g1?
14:13            kmobs+| yes it will be
14:13        poorolgil | Yes

14:23       Bumble-Bee | kmobs the N1 wifi chip can support both 2.4 and 5Ghz bands :-D meaning full N speed . . . . . seems that somthing in android doesnt know about the 2nd band
14:24            kmobs+| what makes you say that Bumble-Bee?

14:27            kmobs+| yeah that sounds right
14:27       Bumble-Bee | make scence with the timing too
14:28           audist | Any idea on how to fix this: "com.process.google.gapps" has closed unexpectedly
14:28           audist | I can't even log in to GTalk

14:30  mode/#Cyanogenmod [+v koush_] by ChanServ
14:30       PsychoI3oy@| and supposedly Shakespeare
14:31            prash@| why do you know this? or what led you to wikipedia it
14:32         slyboots | Sweet, Rebooted correctly :)
14:32       PsychoI3oy@| IMDB's front page has a little birthday thing on the right side
14:32       PsychoI3oy@| I didn't realize Shirley Temple was still alive
14:32          Loonacy | So is Shakespeare.
14:32       PsychoI3oy@| omg hax
14:33       franzjesus | audist: I had the same problem with my HTC branded Magic(32A), but I had forgotten to install the htc_defanged kernel
14:33          Loonacy | He lives off the tears of frustrated high school english students.
14:34           audist | franzjesus: I should be fine with my current CM install, I just used CM updater to update to the latest version
14:34           audist | However, I still get the error
14:34       PsychoI3oy@| audist, did you ever re-flash the defanged base?
14:35       franzjesus | audist: ok, can't help you then
14:35           audist | PsychoI3oy: I tried to, but the root dir was read only
14:36       PsychoI3oy@| er, the root of your sdcard was read only?
14:36           audist | Unless I misunderstood #4 on http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/index.php/Upgrading_From_Older_CyanogenMod_or_other_rooted_ROMs
14:36           audist | I ran cmd, adb shell then couldn't push the file there
14:36           audist | which means I misunderstood the instruction, right?
14:37          Loonacy | audist: Root directory of your sdcard is /sdcard
14:37       PsychoI3oy@| plug phone into computer; tap button on phone to mount to computer; open drive on computer, copy file to drive; unmount from computer (aka 'safely remove'); mount on phone
14:37       PsychoI3oy@| reboot to recovery
14:37           audist | thanks PsychoI3oy and Loonacy
14:37       PsychoI3oy@| flash defanged, flash CM (the latest version will be in the sdcard's cm-updater directory, move it to the root of the sdcard while the phone's mounted on the computer), reboot to normal
14:42           audist | I don't see a cm-updater dir in /sdcard/ but I already have the latest .zip on my desktop, I'll just move that to drive
14:46       Chaddledee | Hi guys
14:46          Loonacy | Hi.
14:46         slyboots | Odd, I cant get adb to work
14:47          Loonacy | That's actually not odd.
14:47         slyboots | Drivers are installed.. Debugmode on the phone is one.. but it just doesnt detect the phone
14:47         slyboots | "Device not found"
14:47          Loonacy | slyboots: Do you have internet tethering turned on?
14:47         slyboots | no
14:48             jeh_ | do u have ur pants on?
14:48          Loonacy | USB Debugging shows up in the status?
14:48         slyboots | ... Yes
14:48          Loonacy | Oh, you're wearing pants?  There's your problem.
14:48             jeh_ | it doesn't work unless u take ur pants off
14:48         slyboots | :P
14:48         slyboots | Yea, USB Debugging is on the notification bar
14:48          Loonacy | What OS?
14:48         slyboots | xp
14:49          Loonacy | Kickin' it old school.
14:49         *     PsychoI3oy still has drive images from his xp install around here somewhere
14:49            deezy | I get debug mode when using a wallcharger
14:49         slyboots | Im at work :P
14:49            deezy | Why
14:49       PsychoI3oy@| deezy, because sometimes the phone is stupid
14:49            deezy | I think its a. Bug in the rom
14:50          Loonacy | deezy: Because i hacked into your phone through the wall socket.
14:50            deezy | The offvcial aosp
14:50            deezy | Gotta be never had that happen before
14:50          Loonacy | I used the Ice-9 virus the CIA developed, like in The Recruit.
14:50            deezy | I'm quite pleased with the official tho
14:51            deezy | Snappiest g1 3d enabled rom I've ran
14:51            deezy | Btw
14:51            deezy | Is there a such thing as a g1 2.0 rom with 1.6 speed?
14:52       PsychoI3oy@| deezy, not yet
14:52            deezy | I love 1.6
14:52            deezy | But I like 2.0s better batterey management
14:52             jeh_ | slyboots : you install the right drivers?
14:52         xaueious | only because you can't run 2.1
14:52         xaueious | lol
14:52         slyboots | Think so.. got em from google and just pointed the windows driver dialog to that folder
14:53         xaueious | muhaha
14:53           audist | well
14:54       franzjesus | audist: is it working?
14:54           audist | I think that re-flash I just did messed up my phone. Market, Gmail, GTalk won't open
14:55           audist | I did a log report
14:55           audist | Looks like the problem is now permissions
14:55             jeh_ | slyboots : did you use these? http://developer.android.com/sdk/win-usb.html instructions?
14:55            prash@| fix_permissions
14:56           audist | yup, saw a little guide on that somewhere on the xda forums, going to find it
14:57            prash@| there is no need for guide, go to terminal type fix_permissions
14:57            prash@| or in recovery console fix_permissions
14:57            prash@| or in amon ra recovery 'fix uid mismatch'
14:58          Loonacy | I just pray to Cthulu.  He keeps my phone running smoothly.
15:01         slyboots | jeh_: Yup..
15:02             jeh_ | slyboots: sorry dude, I don't use windows.. so I'm not really sure why it's not working for you :)

15:09          Loonacy | slyboots: When it says "Turn left at the next intersection" it doesn't mean you should immediately turn, you can wait for oncoming traffic to pass.

10:47        thewizord | isn't android supposed to clear running apps itself? it's using 303mb of it's own memory atm :\
10:47          Wasabeh | !
10:47        laermiggg | but unfortunately there is a lack of buttons

10:49         Scepterr | lol
10:49        laermiggg | that doesnt speed up the G1 ;)
10:49        thewizord | that one you're guaranteed wont release before you learn it, SC2 is now in year 10 of development
10:49        thewizord | what do blizzard and microsoft have in common?
10:50        laermiggg | expensive
10:50        thewizord | it takes 10 years of hacking and extortion for them to develop the next release :P
10:50           Nushio | thing is that sc2 started development in around 2008
10:50        thewizord | laermiggg: that company ALWAYS bites off more than it can chew.
10:50     HarshReality | lol
10:51        thewizord | Nushio: right, but they were piping the concept since 1998
10:51           Nushio | thewizord: not really, they were afraid of the koreans

11:01           Nushio | to me, it wasn't exactly starcraft's multiplayer what kept us hooked, but the map editor, and specifically, the use map settings maps
11:01           Nushio | by us, i mean the group of peeps i still play sc1 and wc3 with
11:02           Nushio | on a side note, the fact that warcraft 3 was made with opengl is strange, they could've easily made an official linux release for wc3
11:02           Nushio | it plays great on wine
11:02        thewizord | Nushio: they're haters
11:03        thewizord | Nushio: and just cos you use opengl doesn't mean you know crap all about porting to linux :P
11:03           Nushio | nope
11:03           Nushio | i'm a java developer
11:03           Nushio | specifically, to avoid the whole "port to mac" "port to window" crap
11:10            xkahn | Nushio: if only Java apps looked okay in Linux
11:10           Nushio | I use the native look and feel
11:10            xkahn | Nushio: the fonts are always crap and the app responsiveness is always wrong
11:10           Nushio | depends on the developer

11:24            ciwrl | rfid = i dont trust
11:24      canadiancow | no not rfid
11:24      canadiancow | like where you insert the card instead of swiping
11:25      canadiancow | i started getting errors a few days ago
11:25      canadiancow | at two stores, after two errors it let me swipe
11:25      canadiancow | but one went into a loop
11:25            ciwrl | rub it against a plastic bag
11:25      canadiancow | because youre not supposed to be able to swipe a chip card if the terminal supports chip
11:25      canadiancow | so insert->"error->swipe", swipe->"insert card", etc
11:25      canadiancow | visa's sending me a new one
11:25         shaggy-h | use a pencil easer to clean it
11:25      canadiancow | but its fucking annoying

11:26      canadiancow | is it really that simple?
11:26         shaggy-h | soemtimes
11:26      canadiancow | like i havent had this card long
11:26      canadiancow | ~6 months
11:26      canadiancow | eraser isnt making any visible difference
11:27         shaggy-h | the magnetic strip has 3x redundancy, so you can get away with a pretty messed up strip. The chip only has a few contact though, if they get dirty you'll obviously run into problems
11:27            ciwrl | hmm havent tried pencil eraser, but the plastic bag works for me
11:27         shaggy-h | yeah plastic bag can work well too - in fact I've often seen checkout operators put the card inside a plastic bag and swipe that. Not sure why that can work but I've seen it do the trick a few times
11:28      canadiancow | but...swiping works fine for me :(

11:33       seraph1024 | shoot
11:33            ciwrl | i couldve sworn that a4d 1.3(or earlier) had the ability to flash recovery.img, why was this removed in 1.4+
11:33            ciwrl | ?
11:34       seraph1024 | you can still flash recovery images on the current a4d
11:34       seraph1024 | just not in the same tab. it's on tab 3 (first spinner).
11:34            ciwrl | hmmm....really?..
11:34       seraph1024 | You can flash recovery, themes, system restores and roms
11:35            ciwrl | "flashing img files is currently not supported"
11:35            ciwrl | :D
11:35       seraph1024 | decided to keep all the flashing in one spot

11:35       seraph1024 | crap

11:35            ciwrl | ok...anyways, ready for your speach in Chi-town?
11:36       seraph1024 | i think the warning was for flashing radio and other images
11:36       seraph1024 | Just got the keynote presentation made up

11:36       seraph1024 | odd thing to like really
11:37            ciwrl | well thats good
11:37            ciwrl | cuz the 'underwear' trick doesnt work
11:37         *          ciwrl was up there in his boxers sweating it out

11:42            ciwrl | you said you enjoy working on wp7?
11:42       seraph1024 | nothing related to "this" community
11:42       seraph1024 | wp7 is interesting. fully silverlight
11:42            ciwrl | i like the ui overhaul
11:42            ciwrl | it was much needed
11:42       seraph1024 | so making an SL app for website, you can recompile and reuse for wp
11:43            ciwrl | yea
11:43       seraph1024 | I like the UI, I like the phone specs.

11:44            ciwrl | haha touche
11:44            ciwrl | mustve been massive in that room
11:45            ciwrl | 300+ gone..
11:45       seraph1024 | I am hearing from MS people that it will have built in memory (32GB+, 800x480 or 320x480, quad core cpu etc)
11:46            ciwrl | wow!
11:46       seraph1024 | they are making the phone and app store more like apple than google
11:46            ciwrl | is that just to run the os? or that much power just to prove they can?
11:46       seraph1024 | not too happy with google app store so..
11:46       seraph1024 | I think 2 CPU for OS and 2 for GPU
11:46        will60031 | I had a text file that got deleted, and need to know how to remount the system partition rw , is it mount -o rw, remount /system
11:46       seraph1024 | and for most street people, that will be 4 CPUs
11:47            ciwrl | will60031 mount -0 rw,remount /system
11:47            ciwrl | err o not 0
11:47            ciwrl | lol
11:47       seraph1024 | OS is fairly light. They shipped out silverlight on most platform. SL might be the next flash.
11:47        will60031 | oh it was you who told me, youa re always there aren't you :D
11:47            ciwrl | will60031 sadly, yes :(
11:47            ciwrl | lol
11:47        will60031 | think thats what I had
11:47       seraph1024 | ciwrl is always here
11:47       seraph1024 | lol
11:48        will60031 | and I typed it from memory yay
11:48            ciwrl | seraph1024 i like how silverlight runs on my comps to be honest
11:48        will60031 | what is -o
11:48            ciwrl | a lot less intensive than flash

11:48       seraph1024 | I like silverlight since I can code it once and it can run on Winblows, OSX and Linux
11:48       seraph1024 | all websites are the same.

13:24       grindking |  i never got a reply from stupid pop cap games about peggle
13:26       waitforit | someone probably took the 10 million dollars and Slyboots phone and ran off with it
13:26        Slyboots | :(
13:26           prash@| i think i got a canned response about peggle
13:26           xkahn | grindking: who cares about peggle?!  Now Plants vs. Zombies....
13:27        Slyboots | PvsZ rocks
13:27       grindking | i've never tried it
13:27         *      Slyboots has it on the PC
13:27       grindking | but peggle was great
13:27       grindking | actually i know why i didn't try it, doesn't the android version have crappy graphics compared to other platforms!? that's not fair!!
13:27        Slyboots | PvZ is .. actualyl a lot of fun
13:27           prash@| well i got popcap beta 'welcome' email, not exactly beta but just we'll email you when shit happens mail
13:27           xkahn | grindking: PvsZ isn't released for Android
13:27           xkahn | grindking: the thing in the market that has that name isn't the real game
13:28       grindking | oh

13:29       grindking | quake1 runs fine!
13:29       waitforit | depends on the phone i guess
13:29        Slyboots | Besides, why play shit like Quake and PvZ when you can play Mobwars!
13:29        Slyboots | Or Progressbar Wars!
13:29       grindking | i want a multiplayer scrabble
13:29       grindking | i love reading the comments on the market
13:30       grindking | they had a yahtzee game and someone was on there commenting saying the game cheats and that it makes you hate life
13:30        Slyboots | I loved that iPad scrable
13:30       grindking | cuz you can't win
13:30        Slyboots | Play scrabble for only $hugenumberofmagnatue more expencive than actual scrabble!
13:31       grindking | yah
13:33        Slyboots | Its like that Gamecube game that needed everyone to have a GBA
13:37        Slyboots | Still wonder if I should have gone for the droid

13:38       waitforit | if you ever get your phone
13:38        Slyboots | True
13:38       waitforit | get one of those tiny bluetooth keyboards for when you really need one
13:39       waitforit | or one of the virtual laser ones
13:39       waitforit | http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/keyboards-mice/8193/?cpg=froogle

13:43        Slyboots | thats.. cool, but check out the freaking price
13:43       waitforit | yeah, but you cant put a price on cool
13:43           xkahn | waitforit: I have a friend with one of those.  He hates it.
13:43       waitforit | xkahn, yeah i dont imagine it would work very well
13:43           xkahn | waitforit: it turns out that keyboards feel the best when you can put your hands down
13:43           xkahn | waitforit: you have to have your hands constantly hovering
13:44         *         xkahn hasn't tried it
13:44       waitforit | that'd get annoying
13:44        Slyboots | And a bluetooth keyboard = more pocket space used up
13:44        Slyboots | Really got enough crap to put in two pockets as it is :P
13:44       waitforit | there was a credit card sized bt keyboard being shown off last year, but i dont think it ever came out

16:39        ciwrl|afk | jdhore1 "<@cyanogen> it's possible to build it, you just need to collect some proprietary libs"
16:39         *    EddieRingle gets out the nerfbat
16:40          jdhore1 | ciwrl|afk, ah, any ideas on where to find them?
16:40        ciwrl|afk | so its up to you to find them as they are not allowed to be distributed....
16:40          jdhore1 | oh
16:40          jdhore1 | ok
16:40        ciwrl|afk | peak into the eris release, and htc sources

16:40    shadowimmage | Can anyone tell me why my home screen sometimes disappears, and the only way to get it back is to reboot?
16:40      EddieRingle | ciwrl|afk: you don't have any random reboots on CM5, right?
16:41        ciwrl|afk | EddieRingle nope
16:41      EddieRingle | ciwrl|afk: CM4 seems to do so, every once in awhile
16:41        ciwrl|afk | :p
16:41      EddieRingle | it just goes "Well, I'm done."
16:41        ciwrl|afk | mine didnt
16:41         finfin82 | does any know the state of cm4?
16:41      FransWillem | Hmmm, so apart from tethering and root access, what else did I gain from switching from stock to cyanogen?
16:41        ciwrl|afk | finfin82 if all goes well...it becomes CM5.0.7 soon
16:41      EddieRingle | finfin82: will probably be discontinued, once CM5 is working
16:41         finfin82 | cyano was hardworking on it i read on twitter...
16:41            prash@| finfin82: cm5 for dream/sapphire device is being worked on constantly past few days
16:42         finfin82 | yeha
16:42         finfin82 | ;-)
16:42      EddieRingle | ciwrl|afk: what was cyanogen's reverse engineering tweet about?
16:42         finfin82 | that sounds very nice
16:42      EddieRingle | is it what I think it is?
16:42        ciwrl|afk | EddieRingle libcamera.so
16:42      EddieRingle | ciwrl|afk: it's working now?
16:42        ciwrl|afk | everything else is functional but the cam
16:42      EddieRingle | oh
16:42         finfin82 | yep, that was the last thing... dunno if it works
16:42        ciwrl|afk | but cyan wont release broken goods
16:42        ciwrl|afk | :)
16:42            prash@| it works :] mostly
16:42      EddieRingle | ciwrl|afk: what if they're only slightly dented? :)
16:42         finfin82 | yep, thats the best thing
16:43         finfin82 | i cant await it
16:43        ciwrl|afk | EddieRingle "i wont release another half working eclair rom"
16:43        ciwrl|afk | so nope
16:43         finfin82 | whats about gl-video?
16:43      EddieRingle | ciwrl|afk: yeah, I saw that tweet too
16:43         finfin82 | is it actualy in 1.6 allready?
16:44         finfin82 | i mean hardwareaccel videoplayback
16:44        ciwrl|afk | you mean hardware accel video? or software? (both are in cm5 already working)
16:44        ciwrl|afk | only thing missing, is the cam
16:44         finfin82 | in stock android 1.6 i mean
16:44            prash@| ?
16:44            prash@| it works on stock
16:44            prash@| 1.6
16:44        ciwrl|afk | what about stock 1.6?
16:44         finfin82 | k
16:44            prash@| as it works on cm 4.2.15.x
16:44        ciwrl|afk | who cares about stock
16:44        ciwrl|afk | lol
16:44         finfin82 | lol
16:45      EddieRingle | ciwrl|afk: working in cm5 with proprietary bits?
16:45            prash@| eclair is a whole another beast
16:45         finfin82 | ciwrl|afk: do you know if we would have to wipe?
16:45        ciwrl|afk | finfin82 i think you will have to wipe
16:45         finfin82 | no problem ;-) i played so much with different roms....
16:45        ciwrl|afk | EddieRingle yes unfortunately, but that can be worked around ;)
16:45            prash@| ii dnno about that, usually cm rom to cm rom you dont need a wipe but we;'ll see
16:45      EddieRingle | I don't mind wiping if it means I get to play with the 2.x SDKs on my G1 :)
16:46        ciwrl|afk | prash but no more defanged = youd have ot wipe..
16:46         finfin82 | i just read cyano say ... my wife would kill me if she will loose all data on update :-D
16:46            prash@| ciwrl|afk: it'd be like n1's install, install rom, install gapps
16:46        ciwrl|afk | yea, but on top of donut? = bad idea imo
16:46        ciwrl|afk | lol
16:46            prash@| donut files would be replaced by gapps
16:46        ciwrl|afk | ...
16:46        ciwrl|afk | we'll see
16:46         finfin82 | ;-)
16:47         finfin82 | i cant wait :-D
16:47        ciwrl|afk | im treating this like the jump from 4.1.11.1 to 4.2
16:47         finfin82 | its like before chrismas
16:47            prash@| i didnt wipe there ;)
16:47        ciwrl|afk | haha
16:47        ciwrl|afk | ok ok, you win prash :p
16:47            prash@| i remember the 9's
16:47         finfin82 | we will see
16:48         finfin82 | but where the hell did those updating market-app the newer app?
16:48            prash@| whatchu talkin bout willis
16:48          blunden | finfin82: ?
16:48     shadowimmage | Is there a way to manually restart/run the home process (android.process.acore)?
16:48        ciwrl|afk | english only!
16:48         finfin82 | http://www.appaware.org/app.php?packagename=com.android.vending @blunden
16:49            prash@| market/vending.apk updates on its own in the background you wont notice it
16:49        ciwrl|afk | yea what he said
16:49            prash@| and so far its only mostly been t-mobile's market that gets updated since they add lame shit
16:49          blunden | finfin82: it was more that your sentence didn't make any sense
16:49         finfin82 | sorry ;-) my english is not the best
16:49          blunden | oh, nvm then :)
16:50          blunden | didn't notice it before that
16:50            prash@| google's planning to move a lot of the system apps to be updated like that, so get used to hidden updates being pushed like that, as far as you know you can't update google apps on your own
16:51         finfin82 | well so nobody has to wait until OTA is comming out for basement updates.... i guess?!
16:51          blunden | prash: didn't they say they were going to put the on Market?
16:51          blunden | like with Maps
16:51         finfin82 | well we wont wait ;-) anyway
16:51          blunden | finfin82: yeah, like Maps that used to be a System app
16:51            prash@| i dont think they'll do it that way, im assuming itll be more like the market update
16:52          blunden | prash: well, from the articles that's what it sounded like
16:52            prash@| less user intervention, the better for them
16:52            prash@| end users tend to fuck shit up
16:52         finfin82 | g
16:52      FransWillem | How can I check if my apps are being installed to the SD card correctly ?
16:52          blunden | prash: also it could be a good use of that "allow auto update" feature rumored to be in FroYo
16:53         finfin82 | start them? FransWillem
16:53          blunden | FransWillem: Settings -> Applications
16:53          blunden | will say for each app where it's installed
16:54         finfin82 | the whole applist stuff is so lame...
16:54         finfin82 | it takes hours ;-)
16:54         finfin82 | the only app that deals with that problem is titaniumbackup as far is i got it
16:54         Slyboots | ?
16:55         finfin82 | even apptrackdog reloads the whole list after switching back from details to the applist
16:55         finfin82 | i mean... when an app has to show a list of apps installed on phone
16:56            prash@| heres an idea, stop installing 300 crapps
16:56         finfin82 | ;-) good point
16:56         finfin82 | i love them all
16:56         finfin82 | i never wanna miss my lightsaber
16:57            prash@| i must be OCD, i go through my app list every few weeks and get rid of shit i havent used more than once a month
16:57            prash@| my list stays around 60-80 at most
16:57            prash@| even on my n1
16:57      FransWillem | prash: Wish there was an app to track when I've last used an app ;)
16:57         finfin82 | yep i do so too prash but it will be around 100
16:57      canadiancow | has anyone else noticed an issue in sipdroid where under certain circumstanced, it will turn on the vibrator, and you have to reboot toget it to stop vibrating?
16:58            prash@| are you sure you didn't leave dildroid on?
16:58         finfin82 | LOL
16:58          blunden | FransWillem: check the Battery Usage page in the Testing menu or in Spare Parts
16:58         finfin82 | hi canadiancow

16:59         finfin82 | lol
16:59          blunden | does that do it for you?
16:59      EddieRingle | yeah, not feeling it
16:59      canadiancow | hi finfin82
16:59          blunden | EddieRingle: damn..
16:59      EddieRingle | blunden: yeah, my ADD is strong
16:59      FransWillem | Hmm, btw, I made an ext3 partition for my apps, now the XDA-dev forum mentions that I should've used an ext4 partition. Is there any actual advantage when using ext4 instead of ext3 ?
16:59         Slyboots | wtf is Dildroid?
16:59            prash@| EddieRingle: Code some more or you're not getting any deserts tonight mister
17:00      EddieRingle | prash: that's dessert
17:00            prash@| Slyboots: search market for it
17:00      EddieRingle | lol
17:00            prash@| ohsnap
17:00         finfin82 | dont tell me there is an app like dildroid could be?
17:00         finfin82 | :-D
17:00      EddieRingle | prash: well good, I don't want any deserts, my shoes would get sand in them!
17:01            PHLAK | quick question for Nexus CM users: Have any of you experienced reboots when enabling WiFi on OS 5.0.6 or higher?
17:01        EugeneKay | dildroid? o.O
17:01     RussellHolly | finfin82: Slyboots: it's pretty common... one of the first apps i ever saw on the original iPhone was iBrate.
17:01            prash@| there is, you can send a special sms to turn dildroid on remotely for your special lady friend (or guy friend for some of you-notthattheresanythingwrongwiththat)
17:01          blunden | PHLAK: nope :P
17:01          blunden | PHLAK: get a log
17:01            prash@| PHLAK: as someone who uses wifi a LOT, nope
17:01        EugeneKay | >_<
17:01         finfin82 | LOL
17:01      EddieRingle | prash: anyways, I need motivation
17:01      EddieRingle | ...
17:01      EddieRingle | prash: where's riku? :P
17:01        EugeneKay | I worry about you guys.
17:02         finfin82 | EddieRingle: you will get dildroid for free ;-)
17:02        EugeneKay | Hint: N1s are not waterproof
17:02            prash@| EddieRingle: makin burgers probably
17:02      EddieRingle | finfin82: not thanks
17:02      EddieRingle | >.>
17:02      EddieRingle | no*
17:02      EddieRingle | prash: probably
17:02            PHLAK | blunden: I use CM on Droid and think the issue was found to be with invalid chars in SSIDs
17:02            PHLAK | created a bug report here: http://code.google.com/p/cyanogenmod/issues/detail?id=1264
17:02            prash@| EugeneKay: girl I got to download that, told me the g1's vibration wasn't strong enough :(
17:02            PHLAK | just was currious if this was happening on the N1
17:02         Slyboots | ... Why would anyone do that?
17:03         Slyboots | Seriously.. its your fucking phone for christ sake
17:03            prash@| cm for droid issues can probably be discussed better in #koush since we're mostly all non droid users
17:03      EddieRingle | Slyboots: flip burgers? for money, probably
17:03         Slyboots | Go buy a dildo you cheap bastards..
17:03         Slyboots | lol
17:03            prash@| Slyboots: since you don't see the humor in it, i think you missed the point
17:03          blunden | prash: true
17:03            prash@| just because you can
17:03         Slyboots | I do, I just./. I can picture people actually doing it

17:16          bcrook+| xndr: yeah, thats appealing. I just need a beastier lappy
17:16       BUGabundo | my laptop is only 13"
17:16            xndr | my dream setup is a ultra portable laptop
17:16            xndr | a beast workstation at home
17:16          bcrook+| BUGabundo: Yeah, but thats input...
17:16            xndr | and a NAS sitting in a closet
17:16            xndr | + a little nettop :)
17:17       BUGabundo | bcrook what you mean?
17:17          bcrook+| xndr: Ion nettop, 13" laptop, beast server for samba/file sharing/etc
17:17            xndr | see the NAS doesn't need processing power
17:17            xndr | just disk space
17:17            xndr | my workstation would be the workhorse
17:17          bcrook+| BUGabundo: I'm confused about what you mean. You say that plasmas suck at video OUTPUT but why would you output video from a plasma
17:18          bcrook+| xndr: yeah, but why not have it all lol
17:18       BUGabundo | not from, to

17:18       BUGabundo | yep
17:18          bcrook+| except with a shittier resolution
17:18       BUGabundo | and almost all TVLCD suck
17:18       BUGabundo | right
17:18          bcrook+| oh okay

17:18           prash@| http://xkcd.com/732/
17:18       BUGabundo | anything above that and gets distorced
17:18          bcrook+| prash: I know
17:19          bcrook+| I saw that. So true
17:19       BUGabundo | prash: LOL I've read it

17:19       BUGabundo | did you read the caption ?
17:19           prash@| yeah
17:19       BUGabundo | lots of ppl don't know about the caption on xkcd
17:19           prash@| heh n00bs
17:19          bcrook+| really?
17:19          bcrook+| handitards
17:19       BUGabundo | LOOOOOOOOOL
17:20       BUGabundo | bcrook you don't know ?
17:20            xndr | goatkcd is much better
17:20       BUGabundo | !g goatkcd
17:20          bcrook+| BUGabundo: No, i do. I didnt know people didnt
17:20       BUGabundo | http://goatkcd.com/
17:20           prash@| lol why oh why did i click knowing full well what it might imply
17:20            xndr | hahahahaha
17:20       BUGabundo | bcrook did you always knew?
17:20          bcrook+| yeah
17:21            xndr | some of them are actually pretty funny
17:21          bcrook+| ever since i read xkcd the first time, not sure when that was
17:21           prash@| SOME is right
17:21       BUGabundo | took me a few editions till I got it
17:21       BUGabundo | before that I almost never got what it meant
17:22           prash@| its just additional joke/punchline
17:22          bcrook+| yeah, i think i got confused by one of the first ones I saw and was looking for something to explain
17:23       BUGabundo | yeap
17:23       BUGabundo | me too
17:24       BUGabundo | it was missing something
17:24       BUGabundo | and when I finally found out there were captions
17:24  mode/#cyanogenmod [+v koush] by ChanServ
17:24       BUGabundo | I became a true Homer
17:24       BUGabundo | DOH
17:27            plum | sup
17:27       waitforit | whoa
17:27       waitforit | apple put the hammer down on gizmodo
17:27            plum | ooh
17:27            plum | source?

17:28       waitforit | wow
17:29            plum | dang
17:29            plum | i'm glad i'm not him now
17:29            plum | he should've hid it in a vault
17:29       waitforit | they took his business cards... how low
17:31            plum | wow
17:31            plum | how the hell did he seem like he was committing a felony
17:31            plum | The warrant published by Gizmodo said the officers had probable cause that Mr. Chen’s home “was used as the means of committing a felony.”
17:32           prash@| well he some how 'acquired' an unreleased iphone which made the steve jobs angry
17:32           prash@| he could have set it all up and gotten it stolen, or stole it himself for the publicity
17:32       waitforit | the warrant says "stolen iphone prototype"
17:32           prash@| im sure they just want to check
17:32           prash@| go through his mails and shit
17:32       waitforit | so they can get him for espionage
17:33           prash@| the employee who let Woz play with an ipad 3g on release day after midnight got fired
17:33           prash@| apple is extremly secretive
17:33     EddieRingle | prash: I read about that, so stupid
17:33       waitforit | sigh
17:33     EddieRingle | Woz founded Apple
17:33           prash@| doesn't matter according to apple hr
17:34     EddieRingle | it's like saying that if Steve Jobs saw the next device, that employee would be fired too
17:34     EddieRingle | should Steve Jobs be fired then? :P
17:34           prash@| well technically woz isnt with apple anymore
17:34           prash@| but in human terms
17:34     EddieRingle | prash: I know, but he still holds a lot of stock
17:34           prash@| it was an idiotically stupid move
17:34           prash@| apple is turning into the big brother types they were marketting so hard against
17:34     EddieRingle | Woz isn't with Apple anymore because it turned into a business
17:35           prash@| rape rape rape
17:35            infz | well, that's what you get when you buy stolen property
17:35     EddieRingle | Gizmodo still did a bad thing
17:35    Sucalakafufu | prash: they were always that type. they just didnt have the power until now
17:35     EddieRingle | they knew they shouldn't have bought the phon
17:35     EddieRingle | phone*
17:36     EddieRingle | this is one instance where Apple is actually justified in suing someone
17:36           prash@| yeah like i said
17:36           prash@| jason chen has always been a media whore/attention whore
17:36    Sucalakafufu | haha
17:36           prash@| he's playign with fire awakening sleeping giant at apple's lawyer teams
17:37           prash@| they have money and influence for all sort of shit
17:37         DaKraut | Hello.  I was wondering what the best way is to completely backup an N1?
17:37           prash@| nandroid
17:37           prash@| best ever. period.
17:37          kep0ne | ^
17:37         -!- phd is now known as prash
17:37         DaKraut | is that on the market, or on the forums?
17:37          kep0ne | forums
17:37         DaKraut | ty
17:38         DaKraut | will that back it up to my computer?
17:38          kep0ne | no
17:38          kep0ne | to the SD card
17:38    Sucalakafufu | prash: is this the same iPhone prototype that we saw earlier? or is it a different one?
17:38       waitforit | EddieRingle, journalists pay for info all the time. and the are protected by law for doing so
17:38          kep0ne | but you can copy it to the computer afterwards
17:38         DaKraut | Gotcha
17:38     EddieRingle | waitforit: not if it's stolen property
17:38    Sucalakafufu | DaKraut: backed up to ur sdcard. from recovery
17:39       waitforit | EddieRingle, if you could prove they knew it was stolen, maybe
17:39          kep0ne | was the phone really stolen or did he just forget it?
17:39       waitforit | they say he left it at a bar
17:39     EddieRingle | the guy sold it to Gizmodo, knowing it wasn't his
17:40            plum | waitforit: i think i remember they worded it differently... they "picked it up" at a bar
17:40         DaKraut | I figured now that I have the phone all setup, except for changing out my sd card (still waiting for it in the mail) I should save a copy incase I screw something up
17:40           bcrook+| DaKraut: nandroid is built into recovery images
17:40          DaKraut | oh, so it should already be on my phone?
17:40        waitforit | giz will win this one, and hopefully they'll stop brown nosing apple on ever 2nd post
17:40        waitforit | every*
17:41             plum | waitforit: giz is, and probably even after this will still be, biased and apple's little pet
17:41             plum | very biased
17:42        waitforit | plum, if so, they deserve every second of this hehe
17:42         Slyboots | Its quite funny..
17:42             plum | i was gonna say the same thing, Slyboots
17:43          Levinax | DaKraut: just create a nandroid folder at the root of your sd card, then boot to recovery, and create a nandroid backup, and it will go there
17:43          DaKraut | Damn, just check the mail and the SD card just got here!! Time to swap out the old one
17:43        waitforit | at least they took his droid away
17:44             plum | waitforit: whose droid?
17:44           Chopes | http://www.tmz.com/2010/04/26/tito-ortiz-arrested-for-domestic-violence-jeanna-jameson/
17:44           Chopes | wow
17:44           Chopes | taking the mma to the pornstar i guess
17:44          Levinax | she had to have known roid rage would play a part in their "relationship"
17:44        waitforit | never mary a porn star isnt that like in the top 5 rules?
17:45          Psylink | she quit for the most part iirc
17:45          Psylink | 3/4 of the stuff that continues to release, is has been filmed 1-2yrs in advance
17:45             plum | why is my connection resetting
17:45             plum | >_>
17:46     Sucalakafufu | plum: it hates u
17:46        waitforit | plum, they took chen's droid along with all the other stuff
17:46             plum | Sucalakafufu: probably
17:46     Sucalakafufu | :(
17:46             plum | oo gotcha
17:46             plum | [INFO]	Ping reply from plum in 1.03 seconds.
17:46             plum | is it supposed to take that long?
17:47        waitforit | its not ideal
17:49             plum | http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa1nzD-n25Q&NR=1
17:49             plum | real or not
17:50             plum | tl;dr: martial arts guy knocks people out without touching them
17:50        waitforit | fake
17:50         Dannyboy | cannonballs can knock people out without touching them
17:51             plum | one move he does is actually one used in dim mak martial arts though (which specialize in acupunctural pressure points)   i think he could actually it do it with that
17:51        waitforit | Dannyboy, thats totally different. there's a pressure wave from an explosion there
17:51         Dannyboy | lol I know... that was kinda my point :P
17:52         *        Psylink knocks plum out via dcc
17:52        waitforit | maybe he's farting and knocking them out
17:52             plum | nuuuuuuuuu
17:52         *           plum knocks Psylink out a bit with a large trout
17:52         *        Psylink cooks the fish with his thoughts and catches it in his mouth
17:52             plum | shit
17:53          Psylink | i need to get stuff to make a tshirt
17:53          Psylink | i have an anti apple tshirt i want to make
17:53             plum | Psylink: pics
17:53          Psylink | i will
17:54        waitforit | Psylink, where do you live?
17:54         Dannyboy | oh wow... that youtube video is making me lol
17:54         Dannyboy | electric bolt!
17:54          Psylink | near pittsburgh
17:54          jdhore1 | About how long does it take to compile/build a copy of CM? (and what CPU, for reference)
17:54          DaKraut | well crap.  How come when I plug my N1 into the computer, my computer doesnt open the SD card?
17:54          Psylink | DaKraut: did you mount it?
17:54        waitforit | Psylink, i can probably get you a few shirts cheap. my mom has a t shirt shop
17:55          DaKraut | It the one that I have in since I in since I out CM on it
17:55          DaKraut | it worked before
17:55          DaKraut | oops, put Cyanogen on
17:56          DaKraut | and its mounted in the phone
17:56          Psylink | i just need to do the work in gimp and get the stuff soon, then ill definitly have pics
17:56          DaKraut | ooops, my bad
17:56          Psylink | DaKraut: when you plug it into the pc, you need to mount the card for usb
17:56     HarshReality | So I guess Chen will be doing his work with paper and pen while at home
17:57     HarshReality | ouch
17:57          DaKraut | should USB debugging always be on?
17:57          Psylink | i hope gizmodo gets boned over this so they hopefully learn to stop bowing at apples feet
17:58          jdhore1 | Psylink, I hope it comes out that they lied
17:58          Psylink | that would be nice as well
17:58          jdhore1 | Psylink, Because IMO, everything about this iPhone 4 story seems fake
17:58           Chopes | Anyone remember where the tutorials are at for the hello world and similar things?
17:58             plum | damn it feels good to be a gangsta
17:59     HarshReality | Im tired of reading reviews that are 'sugar coated'. People omitting details because they have gotten some form of kickback...
17:59          jdhore1 | HarshReality, Well, i think Gizmodo did this for the MASSVIE amount of ad revenue they're getting from it
17:59             plum | they're not getting anything from me... hehe...
18:00             plum | <3 adblock + hosts
18:00     HarshReality | I can honestly say Ive not done reviews online but have done so in person and even gotten a few sweet offers b ut nothing ever stopped me from saying if something was a piece of crap
18:00          jdhore1 | I heard reports that Gizmodo had like 1 million uniques within 2 hours when the iPhone 4 story was new 0.0
18:00      EddieRingle | jdhore1: believe it
18:00          jdhore1 | EddieRingle, i believe that
18:00         *    EddieRingle wishes his blog could get 1 million uniques in 2 hours
18:01      EddieRingle | heck, I'd settle for 1 million uniques per year :P
18:01          jdhore1 | I'll give you one more unique if you want to link it up :D
18:01      EddieRingle | jdhore1: http://eddieringle.com
18:02          jdhore1 | not bad
18:02          DaKraut | So now that I can view the contents on the sd card.  Do I just copy everything to my computer, unmount old card, insert new card, mount new card, then place everthing back on?
18:02     HarshReality | Eddie.. Ill give ya a unique if I can find flash or an xvid player there
18:02     HarshReality | :P
18:03          jdhore1 | EddieRingle, http://eddieringle.com/why-windows-gets-so-many-viruses-plain-and-simple/ <-- i have problems with this
18:03      FransWillem | Hmmm, What's the main reason you guys all decided to keep Cyanogenmod installed ?
18:03      EddieRingle | jdhore1: I speak the truth
18:03      EddieRingle | FransWillem: too lazy to install anything else
18:03     HarshReality | Because its low drama and works
18:03          jdhore1 | EddieRingle, You do, but you forget one critical thing
18:04      EddieRingle | jdhore1: what's that?
18:04          Psylink | FransWillem: it makes me breakfast in the morning
18:04      FransWillem | HarshReality: Would you say it's less low-drama than stock? I'm personally trying it now, and I've already got a few lock ups and force closes which I've never encountered on stock :/ Could be because of apps2sd, though...
18:05          jdhore1 | EddieRingle, On Windows, because its a pain in the ass not to, everyone runs as an administrator, even your grandma...On linux, you should NEVER run as root and many apps basically don't even run (they just print to console: "WTF are you doing running as root. No.") and people are decently careful about sudo
18:05     HarshReality | FransWillem, You have to play the pro/con game. Done be too quick to judge.. I think mine locked once (Moto Droid) but I did a reboot and it never happened again. Also, 99% of issues are covered via the forums
18:06     HarshReality | First best question was did you do a clean factory reset and install
18:07          jdhore1 | EddieRingle, also, you're not going to download a random screensaver pack that comes with a nice handy virus like on Windows in linux, if you want screensavers, you'll get them from the apt/yum/pacman repos or somewhere like gnome-look where things are controlled a bit
18:07      EddieRingle | jdhore1: good point
18:07      EddieRingle | but even as an administrator, Windows still doesn't let me do some things
18:07      EddieRingle | which is annoying
18:08          jdhore1 | Well yes, but that's a whole different discussion :P
18:08          jdhore1 | Also, UAC didn't help anything on Windows because UAC is so bloody annoying that most people just say yes to EVERYTHING and not care what it is or turn UAC off entirely.
18:09          DaKraut | Once I am in Android system recovery, do I just highlight "Backup/Restore" the hit the power button to make a backup?
18:09          jdhore1 | A bit of a brilliant ploy by MS though
18:10         Psylink | DaKraut: try it
18:11         DaKraut | will it give the choice to backup or restore?  I just done want to mess anything up since I am not familiar with android
18:12         Psylink | yes
18:12    HarshReality | Before you do anything you can never go wrong with backup
18:12      Chaddledee | Guys!
18:13         DaKraut | so Nand backup or nand + ext backup?
18:13      Chaddledee | This WePad thing is awesome!
18:13          Chopes | Question about virtualbox for anyone: Once I install the Virtualbox Guest Addons can I unmount that disc or does it need to be in there all the time?
18:13      Chaddledee | It'srunning a custom flavour of Linux.
18:13      Chaddledee | BUT IT RUNS ANDROID APPS.
18:14         Psylink | i want an ADAM
18:15      Chaddledee | Seriously
18:15            plum | what do you guys think of android on iphone?
18:15      Chaddledee | Watch some videos of this WePad
18:15     EddieRingle | woot, my pagerank went up
18:15       waitforit | a waste of a perfectly good android install
18:15         Psylink | DaKraut: the +ext backs up your a2sd partition, so you can do w/ or w/o
18:15    HarshReality | I think its poetic justice
18:15      Chaddledee | And bear in mind that it's screen will be brighter in release version
18:16         Psylink | Chaddledee: link?
18:16      Chaddledee | And that it can run all Linux applications.
18:16      Chaddledee | And android ones.
18:16       waitforit | when do we get the nvidia tegra android phones?
18:16      Chaddledee | Ain't got one
18:16      Chaddledee | On phone
18:17     EddieRingle | Psylink: Google "WePad"
18:17     EddieRingle | their website is first result
18:17      Chaddledee | Search for WePad Working Interface Demo mit dem final design
18:17         DaKraut | Psylink: oh.  I havent put a partition on yet since I knew I was going to get a new sd card.  That will be my next step after backing up and removing contents of my sd card to my computer
18:17     EddieRingle | I suppose it isn't hard to get Android apps working on other Linux distros
18:17     EddieRingle | you just need the Android libs and Dalvik
18:18      Chaddledee | But its a fuckin brilliant idea
18:18     EddieRingle | Chaddledee: indeed
18:18         jdhore1 | Which everyone should do anyway
18:18         jdhore1 | Dalvik >>>> Sun JVM
18:18     EddieRingle | yup
18:19         jdhore1 | EddieRingle, I know this is gonna make me sound like an arse or a hater but...Do you use Ubuntu because you're lazy?
18:19       waitforit | LOL
18:20      Chaddledee | OMG!
18:20      Chaddledee | It has a GUI method of rooting
18:20            plum | sup Chaddledee

11:48     DTgreat|work | =D
11:49         Slyboots | :P
11:49         Slyboots | Oh well, Still got my G1
11:49         *       Slyboots is pretty pleased with Android, they have really upded their game with the quality of the apps
11:49         Slyboots | the ad's are annoying as fuck though
11:49     DTgreat|work | And they are getting better.
11:49         *       Slyboots nods "I remember when I first got the G1 most of them were.. laughably bad"
11:53          aut0tek | Ready for the newbie questions of the morning?
11:56        norschter | i have a problem ..my phone says sdcard removed and hangs and if i reboot it vibrates and dont start and cant get in recovery :( cm4.2.15.1
11:57        norschter | who speaks german ??
11:57          aut0tek | I can try to translate as much as possible, but I know nothing about CM.
11:59         xaueious | have a question about deodexing htc files
12:00         xaueious | not sure which files need the htc framework during deodexing
12:00         xaueious | what's the best way to find out?
12:03      ChrisSoyars@| pooper
12:04  mode/#cyanogenmod [+o prash] by ChanServ
12:04         xaueious | nope?
12:04          aut0tek | so CM isn't a ROM itself?
12:07       PsychoI3oy@| aut0tek, erm, what?
12:07         xaueious | if using deodex
12:07         -!- kmobsHAT is now known as kmobs
12:07         xaueious | can i use -c redundantly?
12:07         -!- riku is now known as Guest51391
12:07         xaueious | like java -Xmx512m -jar baksmali-1.2.2.jar -c :com.htc.framework.jar -d deodexed_JAR -d framework -x "%~dp0app\%~n1.odex"
12:07          aut0tek | I dunno... I'm just wanting to get away from UD, so I was looking at roms. CM came up.
12:08       PsychoI3oy@| xaueious, no idea, try asking in #android-root, jesusfreeke hangs out there
12:08       PsychoI3oy@| aut0tek, of course CM is a rom itself
12:08         xaueious | alright thx
12:08       PsychoI3oy@| aut0tek, i have no idea what would make you think otherwise
12:08          aut0tek | okay. I read somewhere that it wasn't a rom, and only augmented a current ROM.
12:08       PsychoI3oy@| well, you need to flash the googlybits seperately
12:09          aut0tek | Hang on, I might find it again, gimme a sec. I have a couple more questions too
12:09       PsychoI3oy@| but other than that it's a fully functioning fork of AOSP that's pretty heavily modified
12:10       PsychoI3oy@| when the 4.2.x branch came out after the cease&desist from google, we flashed a whole ADP1 rom and then flashed CM over it
12:10          aut0tek | ok nm, it was my lack of reading skills. it says: "You need a compatible ROM..." But then it says: "to use my ROM"
12:10       PsychoI3oy@| but that was just to get the google apps and a few other proprietary files
12:10       PsychoI3oy@| without context i have no idea what you're reading
12:11       PsychoI3oy@| aut0tek, droid, right?
12:11          aut0tek | yes
12:11       PsychoI3oy@| http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/index.php?/forum/37-motorola-droid/
12:11       PsychoI3oy@| specifically the first post pinned there
12:11          aut0tek | It was on the about page on cm site
12:12          aut0tek | but again, it was my fail, not cm's ;-)
12:12       PsychoI3oy@| on the 5.0.x builds you have to flash CM then the 'google addon' for maps/market/gmail/gtalk/etc.
12:12          aut0tek | gotcha
12:13       PsychoI3oy@| and koush has his own channel (#koush) full of other droid users that can probably answer any device-specific question
12:13          aut0tek | will a ROM manager get rid of your current ROM when u change to another?
12:13       PsychoI3oy@| pretty sure
12:13          aut0tek | cool
12:13          aut0tek | but it leaves /data intact?
12:14       PsychoI3oy@| not sure if there's an option to nandroid before install, thought there was
12:14       PsychoI3oy@| i would think so, but don't quote me
12:14            koush+| yeah, there are options to backup current rom, and wipe data before installing a new rom
12:14       PsychoI3oy@| speaking of
12:14          aut0tek | cool.
12:14         *     PsychoI3oy needs to learn a few things about the droid stuff
12:14       PsychoI3oy@| bleh
12:16       Chaddledee | Hey guys
12:17       Chaddledee | I just installed Windows on my bros PC
12:17       Chaddledee | but for some reason I can't change hte aspect ratio to 16:9
12:17       Chaddledee | You guys got any fixes?
12:17       PsychoI3oy@| Chaddledee, install linux
12:17          aut0tek | lol
12:19       Chaddledee | Lol
12:19       Chaddledee | That's what I said
12:19       Chaddledee | but he likes gaming
12:19           tahnok | install the video drivers from whoever made the computer's website
12:19       PsychoI3oy@| crossovergames
12:19          Sturmeh | sup PsychoI3oy
12:20          aut0tek | vmware
12:20          Levinax | couldnt you just change the resolution to something that is 16:9
12:20       PsychoI3oy@| Levinax, stop being reasonable
12:20          Levinax | assuming you have drivers that work with your video cards?
12:22          aut0tek | installing CM won't irritate current Apps on sd will it? Or I suppose I could just download app installer again
12:23          Sturmeh | on sd no
12:23          Sturmeh | depends on compatibility of rom, might use some funky apps2sd
12:24          aut0tek | It's the soon-to-be dirty word. lol. UD10
12:24       PsychoI3oy@| meh, it's already using CM's apps2sd
12:24       PsychoI3oy@| (and most of the rest of CM)
12:24          Sturmeh | then no problem
12:24       PsychoI3oy@| and it's already a dirty word
12:24          Sturmeh | just take the sd out
12:24          Sturmeh | wipe
12:24          Sturmeh | put it back in
12:24          Sturmeh | lol
12:25          aut0tek | lol
12:26          Sturmeh | why did people see the need to use his rom anyway?
12:26          Sturmeh | lol
12:26       Chaddledee | It's really stupid
12:26          aut0tek | I agree, but I suppose I had to try it anyways
12:27       Chaddledee | As part of their whole "making your PC simpler" bullshit, they've removed the option to set the aspect ratio yourself
12:28          aut0tek | I have nvidia tools. U can do whatever u want to with that. free.
12:28       Chaddledee | Oh
12:28       Chaddledee | andmy internet is super slow
12:28          aut0tek | I'll change the aspect ratio to 200:4 if I feel like it. lol.
12:28       Chaddledee | so BT have throttled me probably
12:29       Chaddledee | This is depressingly slow
12:30          Sturmeh | Chaddledee throttled for doing waht/
12:30          aut0tek | Firefox is throttling me, courtesy a little thing I like to call: "recurrent fatal error" lol
12:30       Chaddledee | Well
12:31       Chaddledee | A couple of weeks ago I downloaded SWTFU
12:31       Chaddledee | which is 30GB
12:32          Psylink | the force unleashed?
12:32       Chaddledee | I still have a low ping
12:32       Chaddledee | Yeah
12:32          aut0tek | how do u disable the stock sms program? I'm tired of getting 2 notifications for each message because I like handcent lol
12:32          Psylink | why was it 30gb
12:33          Sturmeh | http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=637419
12:33          Sturmeh | Script will turn on the blue LED when booting so you know it executed (if it annoys you then edit the script and make it pink)

12:34       Chaddledee | On disc it's probably 14GB
12:34          Psylink | oh
12:34       Chaddledee | and bullshit
12:34       Chaddledee | and it's all uncompressed
12:34       Chaddledee | On steam they download EVERYTHING
12:37          aut0tek | I don't download anything 14gb that doesn't cook me breakfast and do the dishes.
12:42      franzjesus | aut0tek: you Can turn of notifications in settings for the stock sms program

12:43      Chaddledee | Waht.
12:43      Chaddledee | The.
12:44      Chaddledee | Fuck.
12:44      Chaddledee | I'd understand cutting my speed in half
12:44      Chaddledee | but making it 2% of what it used to be?
12:44      Chaddledee | You are having a fucking laught

13:01           Ardin | but mount without params will show all current mounts
13:01           Ardin | does "df -h" work on the phone?
13:01         *         Ardin doubts

13:06           Ardin | it has the one feature that keeps me with ipods. Genius Playlists. well, and a familiar interface.
13:06        velazcod | I just went github stalking and noticed a lot of progress on CM-5 for G1. Is it running? I'm not home to sync and test, just curious to see if somehow had already tried it. (I know the camera drivers are still not working 100%)
13:06         Sturmeh | ew genius is a joke
13:06         Sturmeh | who says other people share my taste in music

13:19         Sturmeh | install the defanged image
13:20         jdhore1 | I tried the n1gapps package but...fail...I tried going from defanged DRC83 to CM5, failed...
13:20         Sturmeh | oh cm5
13:20            zinx+| Sturmeh: wrong way
13:20         Sturmeh | hmm
13:20         Sturmeh | no idea
13:20         Sturmeh | i'm sure zinx knows
13:20         Sturmeh | :)
13:20            zinx+| jdhore1: did you try gapps-passion-EPE54B-signed.zip ?
13:21         jdhore1 | My only 2 options that i see are flashing Clockwork Recovery, changing the update-script in n1gapps, telling it to ignore checksums and flashing or adb'ing all the files manually
13:22            zinx+| o_O
13:22         jdhore1 | zinx, i built it for the dream, they require the passion (unless i change the update-script)
13:22            zinx+| i think maybe you should wait for an official release
13:23         Sturmeh | yo zinx, is there anything special i have to do if i want userinit.sh in /system/sd/ to run at boot?
13:23         jdhore1 | Well...the ROM works, and i'm pretty sure the n1gapps would work, its just that damn update-script and the checksums
13:23         Sturmeh | (answer when ur ready)
13:24         yggwork | whats up...
13:24      PsychoI3oy@| Sturmeh, just make sure it's chmod +x
13:24         Sturmeh | it's chmod 755
13:24      PsychoI3oy@| Sturmeh, and add a shebang as the first line
13:24         Sturmeh | yep
13:24      PsychoI3oy@| then it should run
13:24         Sturmeh | #!/system/bin/sh
13:25         Sturmeh | is tha first line
13:25         Sturmeh | also it's chown 0:2000
13:26      PsychoI3oy@| should work
13:27            zinx+| Sturmeh: is it unix or dos format?
13:27         Sturmeh | eh encoding?

13:28     BlackBishop | read it with vim .. vim shows them !
13:28         Sturmeh | lol
13:28         Sturmeh | vim is on cm?
13:29     BlackBishop | it should if it isn't !
13:29            zinx+| if that ends with 0D 0A instead of just 0A, then it's DOS format and must be converted
13:29         jdhore1 | vim isn't on CM, but vi is
13:30           ne1k0 | it's busybox, so it's neither
13:30         jdhore1 | IIRC, vim doesn't compile on Android
13:30         jdhore1 | (I remember seeing a post on the vim-dev mailing list to this effect)
13:30         Sturmeh | -1 isn't a valid flag
13:30         Sturmeh | u mean l?
13:32         Sturmeh | -n 1
13:32         Sturmeh | nvm
13:33         Sturmeh | ok and od
13:33         Sturmeh | doesn't like t flag?
13:34         Sturmeh | zinx there is ^M
13:34         Sturmeh | at end of every line
13:34         Sturmeh | in vi
13:34     BlackBishop | you need to convert it !
13:34         Sturmeh | lolhow
13:34     BlackBishop | get that file on a unixbox and run dos2unix on it !
13:35         Sturmeh | can't i just edit it in vi?
13:35         Sturmeh | <_<
13:35     BlackBishop | you can .. but I'm not vi savy
13:35         Sturmeh | i cbf boot my linux box
13:35         Sturmeh | its 3am
13:35         Sturmeh | yes but what would i be doing
13:35         Sturmeh | search and replace ^M with?
13:35     BlackBishop | delete those ^M's ..
13:35     BlackBishop | with nothing ..
13:35         Sturmeh | just blank line endings?
13:35     BlackBishop | yup
13:36         Sturmeh | know how to put vi in insert mode?
13:36         Sturmeh | :)
13:36     BlackBishop | press i !

15:17            Rinko | What does that mean?
15:17         slyboots | Okay, in recovery :)
15:17            kmobs+| thedude|munches: he updated the script to extract them
15:17         slyboots | right.. I've got to do actual work so.. be back in a bit
15:17             zinx@| bcrook: the original 256MB, "dual 256MB", "mono 256MB", and 128MB
15:17            kmobs+| as for gapps..
15:17            kmobs+| grab them from an n1 temporarily :p
15:18           bcrook+| zinx: I want to be clear. and consistent
15:18  thedude|munches+| ohhhh kmobs  didn't know that
15:18  thedude|munches+| sickness
15:18             zinx@| bcrook: i don't think we have enough info for that
15:18           bcrook+| lol okay
15:18           bcrook+| Rogers phones are 256mb, correct?
15:18             zinx@| yes
15:18         uiterlix | must be somewhere in the build dir
15:18             zinx@| well, no
15:19             zinx@| they are 128MB, but the EBI1 is 256MB
15:19           bcrook+| zinx: Oh right. Fucking dreams
15:19             zinx@| i think it's fine if you just stick to whatever we've been calling it :P
15:19            Assid | are you guys talking about g1?
15:19           bcrook+| Okay
15:19            ciwrl+| Rinko defanged doesnt include radio, so you stay at the rc radio
15:19            ciwrl+| newer radio's = 26I and .02
15:19             zinx@| erh, rather, they have 192MB ram, but the EBI1 is 256MB
15:19           bcrook+| zinx: But yeah, its building. I just CDed to the kernel-msm directory
15:19      krazykrivda | does anyone in here use koush's RM?
15:19           bcrook+| krazykrivda: Yeah
15:19             zinx@| like the "32A"s have 288MB ram w/ a 256MB EBI1
15:20            Assid | zinx: how would you know if you have 256 as a  user?
15:20      krazykrivda | I've devoloped a theme for CM 5062 and I needed testers for it on the N1
15:20             zinx@| Assid: if you have a mt3g LE Fender/1.2, you have 256 in some other location than normall
15:20             zinx@| Assid: otherwise, you can check /proc/iomem
15:20           bcrook+| krazykrivda: Dont love themes but I dont mind helping you out
15:20           bcrook+| krazykrivda: Is it on the RM now?
15:21      krazykrivda | no, but I could have it up in 10-15 min.. PM me
15:21             zinx@| Assid: erh, and if you want to know /actual/ memory, you can check 'free' :P

15:21         -!- EugeneKaway is now known as EugeneKay
15:21            Assid | zinx: and i'm guessing the user doesnt have to choose which rom to get, the code will know how to handle it either way
15:21             zinx@| Assid: /proc/iomem will have System RAM at 0x10000000 for 128MB mapping or 0x19200000 for "32A"/Rogers style 256MB mapping
15:22             zinx@| Assid: no, the user has to choose
15:22             zinx@| Assid: using the new edify stuff, it can detect if it needs 0x10000000 or 0x19200000 iff the correct recovery image is being used
15:23           bcrook+| Assid: They pick the EBI1/32A/whateverthefuckitscalled if they need it
15:23             zinx@| Assid: but it still can't detect if it needs mt3g 1.2/LE fender stuff
15:23           bcrook+| zinx: It can detect which to use? cool
15:23             zinx@| bcrook: i think, though a custom bin may be needed as well
15:23           bcrook+| cool
15:23             zinx@| (edify-style can run programs)
15:24             zinx@| but i don't know which, if any, recovery images for donut will run update-binary
15:24             zinx@| which is the thing that uses the new stuff
15:24           bcrook+| okay
15:24           bcrook+| i'll b back later. Gotta go pick up Win7 for a friend
15:24           bcrook+| hopefully CM doesnt release while I am gone. Or change anything kernel related
15:25     dippingsauce | well lets just hope cyan takes a quick shit in his pants then we get cm5
15:25            Assid | zinx: how about an app a user can install that atleast informs him what hes got.. specially if the person is movng from stock to CM
15:25           bcrook+| fuck. He added something lol
15:25             zinx@| Assid: possible
15:26             zinx@| Assid: i could write it but right now i'm busy w/ other stuff :E
15:26            Assid | zinx: otherwise it would be difficult for even the general users who arent really newbies..
15:26             zinx@| Assid: all it has to do is read the /proc/iomem mappings
15:26             zinx@| (which is readable with no permissions)

15:41      krazykrivda | you scared me dougpiston
15:41          kslater | ciwrl: prash[w]: you guys are saying it's running better / smoother. Does that mean app switching is more predictable? or?
15:41       Chaddledee | I'm not saying it's a good thing
15:41       Chaddledee | just that it isn't HTC's fault.
15:41            Ice_9 | yah, everyone somehow thinks that a Patent Infringement claim always winds up in a nasty court battle
15:41            Assid | true
15:41       dougpiston | krazykrivda sorry didnt know it was meant for n1
15:41            ciwrl+| kslater i have compcache enabled, and overall speed of the entire rom is better than 4.x
15:41       Chaddledee | MS is just bullying everyone to stop the spread of open source.
15:41           UX-Guy | slyboots did you finish the upgrade?
15:41            Assid | thats not good for us is it
15:41      krazykrivda | dougpiston: it's ok.. you can still use it on the droid! I KNOW it works there! :-)
15:41            Ice_9 | a long, nasty court battle fraught with injunctions usually winds up hurting a company more financially than simply settling up front
15:42            Ice_9 | a tiny, 300 person company called Rambus proved that
15:42       Codenomics | i see talk of CM for D/S... released?
15:42          kslater | ciwrl: requires DangerSPL or did you have that in place anyway?
15:42       dougpiston | krazykrivda is it the gold se one you used tto have up on alldroid?
15:42       Chaddledee | Codenomics: Read the topic.
15:42         prash[w]@| i alrready had dangerspl to begin with so not sure
15:42       Codenomics | grr
15:42            ciwrl+| kslater for now danger only, but the goal is not to need danger
15:42      krazykrivda | dougpiston: yeah
15:43            Assid | i'd really like to see  google picking up palm and their vast screen input and mobile computing patents
15:43       Chaddledee | Yeah
15:43         *        kslater is a-scared of DangerSPL
15:43       Chaddledee | Palm have a SHEEEEET load of patents.
15:43            Ice_9 | yeah, but they have no leverage
15:43       Chaddledee | Like, more than anyone else for handhelds.
15:43       Chaddledee | It's just they have no money
15:43         uiterlix | software patents should be abandoned
15:43       Chaddledee | True.
15:43            Ice_9 | they're in a similar situation that SCO was in not too long ago
15:44       Chaddledee | But it doesn't stop the fact that they haven't been.
15:44            Assid | Chaddledee: hence why i'd like to see google snatch them
15:44       Chaddledee | Yeah.
15:44          Wasabeh | Yay, apps2sd wurx!
15:44            Ice_9 | someone will snatch them for a song
15:44            Assid | basically tell hardware vendors.. okay gont worry..we got you guys covered.. you dont need protection money
15:44       Chaddledee | I'd like to see Google get pissed off with MS
15:44      krazykrivda | anyone on N1 using Rom Manager?
15:44       Chaddledee | for the whole Android thing
15:44            Ice_9 | the fact that propsective buyers keep pulling out just weakens the portfolio's cost
15:45            Assid | im sure this should get them thinking... that their stand is probably starting to get undermined
15:45     DTgreat|work | krazykrivda I am.
15:45            Ice_9 | if Google WERE to purchase their IP portfolio, they may even have enough to go up against Microsoft
15:45            ciwrl+| blunden!! you made the changelog! * APN list updated by Paul Weiss, blunden, and PsychoI3oy.
15:45            ciwrl+| youre famous!
15:45            ciwrl+| lol
15:45      krazykrivda | DTgreat|work: would you mind testing out a theme?
15:45     DTgreat|work | krazykrivda Sure, got a SS?
15:45       Chaddledee | In terms of handhelds, Palm's portfolio > EVERY ELSE EVER.
15:45            Ice_9 | yep
15:45      krazykrivda | SS?
15:46            Assid | Ice_9: right.. but with google's do no evil.. they would probably just tell apple to go to hell else suffer consequences
15:46     DTgreat|work | krazykrivda Screen shot
15:46          blunden | ciwrl: haha, cool :P
15:46            ciwrl+| :)
15:46            Ice_9 | assid, no - I doubt that. They'd have to defend themselves or pay up
15:46            Assid | pretty much what ibm did with their whole SCO case
15:46       Chaddledee | I'd like to see Google snap up Palm.
15:46       Chaddledee | Then make everyone play fairly
15:46          blunden | took quite a long time making CM better was worth it
15:46      krazykrivda | ha yeah sry..
15:46       Chaddledee | If anyone tries to sue anyone else, Google sues the shit out of em.
15:46            Ice_9 | SCO going up against IBM was probably the stupidest move SCO could have done
15:47      krazykrivda | DTgreat|work: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=646284&page=6
15:47            Assid | Chaddledee: hahaha.. yeah! palm police :P
15:47            Ice_9 | you don't take a failing business model and try to strongarm a sleeping giant like IBM over a pesky set of linux patents.
15:47     DTgreat|work | Oh, cool I was going to flash that yesterday krazykrivda
15:47       Chaddledee | Apples tries to sue Nokia, Google slaps em round the back of the head with Palm's patents.
15:47            Assid | ya hear me google! do it already! pick up palm!
15:47            Ice_9 | especially when there's prior art by Novell lol
15:47      krazykrivda | well the MM there is out of date.. i added to RM just now..
15:47            Ice_9 | assid, buying palm could cause Microsoft to sue right away
15:48            Assid | Chaddledee: yeah.. but if apple picks them up.. things go badd...real bad
15:48            Ice_9 | assid - I doubt that... there's another element here...
15:48       Chaddledee | Microsoft tries to sue HTC, Google murders the fuck out of em.
15:48            Assid | Ice_9: not really.. dont forget android is still open source.. its not really doing anything with microsoft
15:48            Ice_9 | HTC is already up against Apple...
15:48            Ice_9 | both Google AND microsoft are partners with HTC...
15:48       Chaddledee | I mean, hopefully Google wouldn't use them agressively.
15:48            Assid | they are just telling people to back off
15:48       Chaddledee | Just defensively on behalf of all smartphone makers.
15:48            Assid | yep
15:48            Ice_9 | if Palm gets bought up by apple, you'll see MS, Google and HTC all team up against Apple
15:49            Assid | pretty much
15:49            Ice_9 | and Apple would have no choice but to back the fuck down
15:49       Chaddledee | Lolno.
15:49       Chaddledee | Well.
15:49       Chaddledee | Sort of.
15:49            Assid | actually the deal wont go through
15:49       Chaddledee | Microsoft is fondling HTC's balls, but threatening to rip em off.
15:49            Ice_9 | Well, they COULD fight - but man, that would be one ugly shareholders meeting come the next quarter
15:49         prash[w]@| htc should just move completely to android os anyway
15:50         prash[w]@| fuck winmo
15:50            Assid | dont forget the govt will probably intervene saying it screws competition.. and apple vs htc will just be a prime example
15:50            Ice_9 | winmo is strategically viable for HTC
15:50            Ice_9 | why cut yourself out of those profits?
15:50            Ice_9 | doesn't make sense from a business perspective.
15:50            ciwrl+| yup $$ = good
15:50            Assid | exactly
15:50            Assid | hell if htc buys palm
15:50            Assid | they can tell MS and apple to start sucking
15:50            Ice_9 | nah, they'll cross-license
15:51            Ice_9 | they'll play nice in the interests of making more money and gaining more market share
15:51            Assid | yeah thats more likely the case
15:51            Ice_9 | they'll screw apple tactically and with a smile on their face.
15:51       Chaddledee | I hope that Google gets Palm.
15:51            Assid | wich is why i want google to snatch it..
15:51       Chaddledee | and gets an iron grip on the whole patent system
15:51            Ice_9 | they'll wait until a few more companies bail on them lol
15:51            Assid | specially after world mobile congress
15:51            Assid | they pretty much are int he limelight
15:51            Ice_9 | people want that patent portfolio, but it comes at a huge cost - assuming their debt
15:52       Chaddledee | annd then says "Anyone can use these patents as long as we get to use yours."
15:52            Assid | yep
15:52            Ice_9 | I learned a lot about patent law as a Rambus shareholder
15:52            Assid | keeps competiton in the game
15:52       Chaddledee | "And we will litigate the shit out of you if you don't cross-license with us."
15:52            Ice_9 | it was probably the most interesting 2 yers of my life.
15:52            Assid | buy shares in palm
15:53         -!- Haraken_ is now known as Haraken
15:53            Assid | if anyone snatches it
15:53            Assid | its going to be worth alot of money
15:53  AstainHellbring | if no one does then money gone
15:53            Assid | well
15:53            Assid | keep your risk low
15:53            Ice_9 | depends on if their IP is cherrypicked and doesn't come bundled with their debt
15:53            Assid | like 200-500 bucks
15:53            Assid | Ice_9: or if they sell it for a song
15:54            Assid | man.. im getting to uptight abt it.. as if i own the compnay
15:54            Assid | hehehe
15:54            Ice_9 | it got that way with me and RMBS. too much stress.
15:54            Ice_9 | I sold it before it killed me
15:54            Assid | perhaps the open handset alliance may wanna buy it out
15:54       Codenomics | wonder if adding some nutella to this orange chicken would ruin it...
15:54            Assid | and make it part of the community
15:55            Ice_9 | codenomics, hazelnut + orange? I'd avoid
15:55       Codenomics | yeah, probably would ruin the nutella
15:56      Charansingh | cyanogen: did u sign the latest upload to git. I get a warning project 'repo' branch 'stable' not verified
15:56      Charansingh | cyanogen: not signed
15:56          Loonacy | Charansingh: That's referring to the "repo" program itself, i believe.
15:57      Charansingh | loonacy: I have been syncing perfect before n another warning is skipped upgrade to unverified version
15:58          Loonacy | Charansingh: Yeah, there's probably an upgrade to repo that you're not getting.

16:08       thedeanius@| wth..
16:08            Assid | all i got was my keyboard to show up

16:08         |Jason8| | i heard fennec takes like 50mb of install space
16:08         |Jason8| | and it has to be installed on the phone
16:08         |Jason8| | can't do apps2sd with it
16:08       Chaddledee | Fennec is 30mb
16:08       thedeanius@| ahh

16:10            Ice_9 | if they have the Droid Incredible, they should have the Droid Mediocre, the Droid Somewhat-Snappy, the Droid Perpetually-Getting-Warranty-Service, etc

16:11            Ice_9 | the HTC Brick! :)
16:11       Chaddledee | Looking at the vids, it looks a lot faster than a G1 anyhoo
16:12       Chaddledee | Most definitely faster than the Nokia "smart"phones that you get for £15/m
16:12            Assid | Chaddledee: the g1 isnt as quik?
16:12         |Jason8| | i has a G1
16:12      krazykrivda | anyone using Rom Manager app on an N1.. I need a quick check of seomthing
16:12         markatto | the G1 has significantly less CPU, so it would make sense
16:12         |Jason8| | rom manager?
16:12          RoflzxD | its a great app..
16:12         |Jason8| | ...
16:13       Chaddledee | I mean, the RAM doesn't seem as much a problem when you have a fast CPU with Android.
16:13       Chaddledee | Once you are running low on RAM, it still killing processes
16:13       Chaddledee | and it's hte having to start them up all over again that slowed down the phone
16:13            Assid | we need to start using swap
16:14       Chaddledee | but if you got a fast enough processor, that shouldn't be a problem.
16:14      krazykrivda | so anyone care to check something on RM?
16:14            Assid | i'd think the g1 would be quick enough
16:14            Assid | damn.. i just bought one

16:46     dippingsauce | you forgot to call him a filthy whore
16:46      EddieRingle | mdmadph: Palm should have gone bankrupt and faded

16:46      EddieRingle | dippingsauce: nope, I just wanted to smack him

16:47          mdmadph | EddieRingle: webOS is the best mobile OS to design for, hands down.
16:47      EddieRingle | prash[w]: I HAVE NONE
16:47         *     Chaddledee gives EddieRingle evils
16:47          mdmadph | If Android looked like webOS, the iPhone wouldn't be worth a damn.
16:47      EddieRingle | mdmadph: obviously not if they were about to go bankrupt
16:47          mdmadph | As is, Android is ugly as sin.
16:47     dippingsauce | ?
16:48         prash[w]@| you like webOS ui? wtf is wrong with you
16:48          mdmadph | EddieRingle: the engineers in charge of the company don't have anything to do with the marketers, which is why Palm was in trouble. :P
16:48     dippingsauce | is this guy serious prash?
16:48      EddieRingle | they should have let the auto companies fail too
16:48       Chaddledee | mdmadph: WebOS is easiest to develop for, and it's completely free at the moment
16:48          mdmadph | prash[w]: I've done design work on them all -- webOS is easiest by far.
16:48          mdmadph | have you done serious application design on a corporate level for all mobile OS?
16:49          mdmadph | I have, and I've used all their IDE's, and tested on lots of different platforms.
16:49     dippingsauce | so easy makes the platform better?
16:49          mdmadph | YES, since everything to day is APPS APPS APPS. :P
16:49     dippingsauce | hm
16:49          mdmadph | "easy" makes more apps just happen.
16:49       Chaddledee | BTW, he hasn't said that WebOS is hte best OS
16:49          mdmadph | Oh, I wont' say that. :P
16:49     dippingsauce | easy makes more flashlight apps
16:49       Chaddledee | He just said it's best to develop for
16:50          mdmadph | That's Android, because it's open.
16:50       Chaddledee | Which is true
16:50          mdmadph | but webOS is far, far, far easier to design for.
16:50       Chaddledee | Yeah
16:50          mdmadph | And it's far, far prettier. :P
16:50          mdmadph | Makes even the iPhone look like shit.
16:50        BUGabundo | sooooo
16:50        BUGabundo | what did I miss so far?
16:50          mdmadph | webOS will be the Betamax of our generation.
16:50       Chaddledee | Everything makes iPhone look shit after you run out of Kool-Aid
16:50      EddieRingle | BUGabundo: the Nexus Two is out
16:50      EddieRingle | that's what you missed
16:50        BUGabundo | cool
16:50             dang | Aside from the whole "webos is great" thing, what does HP want with it?
16:50          mdmadph | A bunch of older guys like me hariping on about how it was suprerior long after it's gone. :P

16:51         *      BUGabundo goes to the chinese store to buy one
16:51          mdmadph | dang: it's worth far more than what they bought it for, too.
16:51       Chaddledee | PATENTS.
16:51          mdmadph | That too.
16:51       Chaddledee | Worth a billion times more than WebOS or the name.
16:52     dippingsauce | if motorola makes the nexus two or pro or whatever they wanna call it im def not buying it
16:52         *         tommie wants a nexus with the keyboard of the G1
16:52       Chaddledee | Really?
16:52         *        mdmadph wants an Touch Pro 2 running Android
16:52       Chaddledee | But Moto only suck at software

11:52    optedoblivion | :-D
11:52  kwhohasamullet_ | Hey Guys, in your opinions is it worth going through the process of putting danger SPL onto my G1 is preperation for the 5.x release? or should i just wait until the actual release?
11:52          Sturmeh | i did optedoblivion
11:52       Seraph1024 | when you do you need this done by?
11:52          Sturmeh | kwhohasamullet wait
11:52         cyanogen@| 5.0 will be worth going to dangerspl
11:53            Assid | clowe: get.skyfire.com from your browser phone
11:53          Sturmeh | of course it will, but not worth all the dangerspl troubleshooting :P
11:53          Loonacy | kwhohasamullet: I've been running dangerspl forever with no problems.
11:53            prash@| ciwrl has alreayd made some guides on dangerspl, hopefully people spend time READING
11:53          Sturmeh | kwhohasamullet, long story short u have to wipe all for dspl, so do it when u install 5.0
11:53  kwhohasamullet_ | yeah i was looking at the guide that someone wrote up in teh cyanogen forums and seens i have some spare time tonight was considering doing it
11:53            prash@| yeah the guides on the forum
11:53         cyanogen@| i'm not even considering a no-wipe upgrade from 4.2
11:53         cyanogen@| if it works, cool
11:53          Sturmeh | of course
11:53          Sturmeh | :P
11:54            prash@| cyanogen: i did no wipe upgrade from 4.2
11:54         cyanogen@| but i'm not gonna bust my balls over it
11:54            prash@| works perfectly fine
11:54          Sturmeh | u need to wipe anyway, but why wipe twice
11:54         cyanogen@| oh really
11:54          Sturmeh | i need a functional phone today
11:54       Codenomics | cyanogen finished sh*tting his pants yet?
11:54          Sturmeh | :P
11:54         cyanogen@| awesome then :)
11:54            prash@| i treid it on the pre builds
11:54          Sturmeh | haha
11:54         cyanogen@| i think we found a karanal bug though
11:54            clowe | assid: i'm on the page, when i click the download button, i'm prompted for either browser or market
11:54       logomancer | Gah, which branch is that XML file in?
11:54         cyanogen@| at least zinx and i are seeing it
11:54            clowe | chose both, wasn't able to get it either way
11:54         cyanogen@| crazy suspend/resume cycles
11:54            Assid | clowe: choose the link that says no market
11:54            bri3d | cyanogen: you need to put some jesus in your kernalz
11:55            clowe | WERD
11:55            bri3d | hmm I have a G1 here but it's my boss's
11:55        thedudeTM+| it's karanalz
11:55            clowe | really lame tho
11:55            bri3d | I wonder if he'd mind if I DangerSPLed it
11:55            bri3d | xD
11:55            bri3d | thedudeTM: eatin some karnalz of corn
11:56       Codenomics | darn bugs
11:56            bri3d | maybe I'm in a minority but I fucking love the slide/keyboard on the G1
11:56            bri3d | if they made a faster one I'd buy it in a heartbeat
11:56            clowe | i used to think that also bri3d, then i got the n1 w/swype
11:57            clowe | so great
11:57            bri3d | clowe: I have N1 with swype I'm not that impressed
11:57            bri3d | :|
11:57           UX-Guy | mt3g + swype == <3
11:57          Sturmeh | lol
11:57            clowe | not sure how you could not be impressed
11:57          Sturmeh | sif
11:57            clowe | so fast
11:58       logomancer | Hmm. Found it. Not much there...
11:58            bri3d | clowe: well, I like the N1 just fine, but I'd like the N1 in the G1's formfactor even better
11:58            bri3d | is what I'm saying
11:58     Sucalakafufu | g1+swype is also fast. just not AS fast :P
11:59            bri3d | and I'm not really impressed by Swype, it's certainly fantastic but I'd still rather have a real keyboard
11:59            bri3d | Swype sits somewhere between onscreen QWERTY and Real QWERTY for me
11:59            bri3d | with "Droid Keyboard" somewhere out in hell
11:59          Sturmeh | lol
11:59            prash@| swype is best keyboard evar
11:59           UX-Guy | I refuse to turn my phone on it's side to type now
11:59          Sturmeh | bri3d it's the equivilent of a big list of words that are all within reach
11:59           UX-Guy | one handed swyping or nothing
11:59            prash@| its all ican use on my n1 since ive used nothing but physical keyboard phones for past 5 yearas
12:00            bri3d | Sturmeh: try using Swype to ssh into shit and do work
12:00            bri3d | it doesn't go very well
12:00          Sturmeh | :P
12:00          Sturmeh | exactly my point
12:00            bri3d | yeah
12:00          Sturmeh | u can manually type with it
12:00          Sturmeh | but meh
12:00       logomancer | cyanogen, have you tried foregroundgravity:center_horizontal?
12:01       logomancer | Er...foregroundGravity:center_horizontal?
12:01            clowe | this skyfire browser is dece actually
12:01         shaggy-h | I had a typing race yesteday with swype against a long-term iphone user. I utterly destroyed him with just one thumb :)
12:01         cyanogen@| no
12:02         cyanogen@| Defines the gravity to apply to the foreground drawable.
12:02            Assid | swype works on the g1?
12:02         cyanogen@| i'll try it
12:02       logomancer | nods
12:02          Sturmeh | yes Assid
12:02       logomancer | Looking at the FrameLayout docs right now, saw that.
12:02    optedoblivion | wow...I am appalled at the new verizon commercial....http://bit.ly/cF6YhG
12:02            Assid | sweet.. will get it when i get m y g1
12:02          Sturmeh | lol
12:02            bri3d | swype kills iphone keybaord
12:02            bri3d | *keyboard
12:02          Sturmeh | duh
12:03            bri3d | hell, swype probably kills physical keyboard for texting and shit
12:03            bri3d | but for doing work I want a physical keyboard
12:03            bri3d | lol
12:03         cyanogen@| well no procs actually have a hw3d node open
12:04          Sturmeh | cyanogen is launcher2 going to be in there? ( as optional even? )
12:04           UX-Guy | optedoblivion just a teaser
12:04 BUGabundo_remote | shaggy-h: pics or it didn't happen :)
12:04            Assid | anyone here got an archos
12:05         cyanogen@| no change
12:05       logomancer | Damn.
12:05          Sturmeh | ps. anyone who knows can answer :P
12:05            prash@| strumeh, no launcher2 included, its bloat
12:06          Sturmeh | aw :P
12:06          Sturmeh | is it using donut launcher then?
12:06    optedoblivion | UX-Guy: I was more so appalled at the matrix screensaver they added some rotation and other text to.
12:06          Sturmeh | or does eclair have a fallback
12:06         cyanogen@| no it's the eclair regular launcher :)
12:06          Sturmeh | ah i didn't know it had one
12:06          Sturmeh | is that what droid had?
12:06            prash@| eclair has launcher as well
12:06         cyanogen@| it does have support for LWPs but you are crazy if you use them
12:06           UX-Guy | cyanogen, you mentioned having set fill_parent... but do you have fill_horizontal
12:06            prash@| cyanogen, our users are machocists
12:07           UX-Guy | optedoblivion lol
12:07         cyanogen@| i'm including the support but i'm not including any actual wallpapers
12:07         cyanogen@| some work, some done
12:07         cyanogen@| dont
12:07         cyanogen@| earthrot works
12:07         cyanogen@| renderscript stuff sort of does
12:07         cyanogen@| magicsmoke crashes when you enter settings
12:07            prash@| earthrot itself is pretty hefty
12:08         cyanogen@| fill_horizontal?
12:08         cyanogen@| where?
12:08         brinstar | cyanogen, just wanted to say thanks for your damn hard work
12:08           UX-Guy | cyanogen on android:forgroundGravity http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/FrameLayout.html
12:09       logomancer | He just tried it, no go
12:09       logomancer | Here's the relevant layout code as of last commit:
12:09           UX-Guy | saw that he tried setting to horizontal_center
12:09             Rede | Just curious... will those of us with sapphire devices and more space be able to install things like Launcher2 and LWP?
12:09       logomancer | <FrameLayout
12:09       logomancer |         android:id="@+id/lockPattern"
12:09       logomancer |         android:layout_width="fill_parent"
12:09       logomancer |         android:layout_height="0dip"
12:09       logomancer |         android:layout_weight="1"
12:09       logomancer |         android:layout_marginTop="2dip"
12:09           UX-Guy | but wasn't sure about fill
12:09       logomancer |          />
12:09          Sturmeh | Rede yes but not reccomended
12:10         cyanogen@| yeah the code grabs it by id, looks at it's height and width, then chops it up into 9 segments
12:10             Rede | cool... LWPs are just a battery drain, but i wanna show off to iphonies
12:10           UX-Guy | is the parent still set to an HDPI aspect ratio?
12:10         cyanogen@| so the height and width sent to the code is wrong
12:10          Sturmeh | Rede also a waste of space but sure why not :P
12:10             Rede | and Launcher2 is just fun :P
12:10          Sturmeh | lol
12:10         cyanogen@| i dont think so
12:10           topfs2 | Love the AWDLauncher though
12:10         cyanogen@| http://n0rp.chemlab.org/lock.png
12:10           topfs2 | works wonders on donout already
12:10         cyanogen@| other stuff is centered
12:11          Sturmeh | lolwut
12:11       logomancer | Maybe some underlying code expecting WVGA?
12:11          Sturmeh | wrong way no?
12:11            prash@| thats on device right? not simulator?
12:11          Sturmeh | looks like sim
12:11          Sturmeh | D:
12:12          Sturmeh | or more like no sim xD
12:12            prash@| when iwas working with the simulator it didn't show what I saw on the device
12:12            prash@| it was really frustrating
12:12         -!- kmobsHAT is now known as kmobs
12:12          Sturmeh | really?
12:12         cyanogen@| no i mean all it does is get the width and divide it by 3
12:13            prash@| from the looks of the screen shot, its just placed on left, doesn't seem to be doing the dividing portion
12:13          blunden | prash: mine keep bugging out and turn to 160dpi on my hdpi emulator
12:13          Sturmeh | so basically it's either that or retarded ovals?
12:13          blunden | so yeah, it can be unreliable
12:13       logomancer | Hmmm...
12:13            prash@| cyanogen: try adding extra space dips in front of the code for the roundies
12:14           UX-Guy | cyanogen don't suppose there is another child within that space that is set left then
12:14            prash@| or blank pngs
12:14       logomancer | This is the XML layout: http://github.com/cyanogen/android_frameworks_base/blob/eclair/core/res/res/layout/keyguard_screen_unlock_portrait.xml
12:14         cyanogen@| the linearlayout above it is gravity=left
12:14           UX-Guy | I know I'm probably not helpful, but trying
12:14         cyanogen@| but it's not enclosed in it
12:15         cyanogen@| this could be in the code too
12:16       logomancer | Hmm...
12:16            kmobs+| maybe the height is hardcorded?  I know they like to do that in luancher
12:16            kmobs+| they'll make half of it variable, and the other half hardcoded wit hthe variable part in comments
12:16            kmobs+| hardcoded*
12:16         cyanogen@|         final int width = wm.getDefaultDisplay().getWidth();
12:16            kmobs+| (i suck at typing this morning)
12:17         *     Codenomics wants pancakes
12:17            kmobs+| oh btw the sperm live wallpaper causes the phone to run out of memory and soft reset
12:17          Loonacy | Too bad, you're getting WAFFLES!
12:17       PsychoI3oy@| cyanogen, the build fingerprint in build.prop on my CM5.0.7DS out/target/product/dream_sapphire/system is "ro.build.fingerprint=google/passion/passion/mahimahi:2.1-update1/ERE27/24178:user/release-keys"
12:17            kmobs+| Dunno if there's anything you can do
12:17       Codenomics | lolol
12:17       PsychoI3oy@| is that intentional?
12:17            prash@| that lwp crashes on my nexus too
12:17         cyanogen@| yeah lots of them do
12:17     Sucalakafufu | kmobs: too much sperm? haha
12:17       PsychoI3oy@| build.description above it is also passion-user
12:18            kmobs+| I tried to set it on my roommate's phone as he was sleeping
12:18         cyanogen@| yeah i hack the build description
12:18            kmobs+| but it kept crashing :(
12:18         cyanogen@| so market works
12:18       PsychoI3oy@| gotcha
12:18       PsychoI3oy@| figured as much
12:18          Sturmeh | guiz waiting for some Hardcore Archiving Action
12:18       Codenomics | Loonacy: i can do waffles
12:18       PsychoI3oy@| though won't most n1 apps fail at mdpi?
12:18       PsychoI3oy@| eh, i guess that's more fun for Users, heh
12:19            prash@| it should resize properly down as well as up
12:19         cyanogen@|         final int width = w - this.getPaddingLeft() - this.getPaddingRight();
12:19         cyanogen@|         mSquareWidth = width / 3.0f;
12:19       logomancer | If app providers are doing their job, that is.
12:19       NCommander | hola
12:19         slyboots | haha, Man the BNP is freaking funny
12:19       PsychoI3oy@| prash, and we can see how well that's going with the pattern lock screen
12:19          Sturmeh | what's w
12:19         cyanogen@| PsychoI3oy:  it won't use hdpi stuff
12:19         slyboots | Their "proposals" for if they ever get into power border on madness
12:19       logomancer | What source are you looking at, cyanogen?
12:19       PsychoI3oy@| hmm
12:19         cyanogen@| just because of the buidl fingerprint
12:19         slyboots | "British National Party" kind of like a watered down version of the neo-nazis
12:20            prash@| does the lockPattern have hardcoded values in source?
12:21         *     PsychoI3oy says fuckit and puts his phone in the hands of the phone gods
12:21           UX-Guy | cyanogen what if you had the parent measure the child, size the width appropriately and set the gravity on the parent/
12:21            kmobs+| cyanogen: so is it taking the width and just dividing it into thirds (after it subtracts all the padding?)
12:21            prash@| right kmobs
12:21         slyboots | Anyhow :)
12:21            kmobs+| maybe the values of the padding needs to be adjusted?
12:21         slyboots | relaly enjoying Cyanogen..
12:21         slyboots | Waking by touching the trackball is.. great :)
12:22         cyanogen@| there is no padding though
12:22            prash@| but there is no padding that i can see
12:22           UX-Guy | slyboots enjoys stroking the ball
12:22         slyboots | I dont suppose there is a way to .. Supercharge GPRS ? ;)
12:22       NCommander | cyanogen: so with 5.x on G1, can't we abuse cache?
12:22         slyboots | Make it like.. 10x faster
12:22         slyboots | Cause that would be great
12:22            prash@| its [img][img][img]
12:22            kmobs+| NCommander: if you have dangerspl, you run out of room in cache
12:22       NCommander | cyanogen: maybe go as far as moving all the default apps to /cache and leaving /data virtually empty
12:22         cyanogen@| NCommander:  cache is for temporary data, it can be wiped anytime
12:22       NCommander | kmobs: so have autodetection in the installation update.zip
12:23       NCommander | cyanogen: what wipes it as part of the stock system?
12:23         slyboots | Im not sure if I'll bother with Apps2SD thjough
12:23         slyboots | It was.. painfully slow on my G1
12:23            kmobs+| NCommander: and yeah as cyanogen said, cache is wipedoften.. for example, if you flash an udpate.zip
12:23       NCommander | slyboots: just make sure you have a fast SD card
12:23         brinstar | is there a way to check if i have installed DangerSPL or not, because its been so long i cant remember?
12:23            kmobs+| so if someone flashes the update, then the gapps update, everything in the cache from the orignal update is gone
12:23         brinstar | i think i have
12:23       NCommander | kmobs: that behavior can be changed by modifying recovery images.
12:24         cyanogen@| i'd rather have people go dangerspl i think
12:24         cyanogen@| it's less hacky
12:24         cyanogen@| and less work for me
12:24            kmobs+| brinstar: can't he just get the size of the cache partition?
12:24         slyboots | NCommander:It was a Class 4 Sandisk
12:24            prash@| brinstar: hold camera during bootup in the hboot screen if you see 1.33.2005 or whatever its dangerspl
12:24         cyanogen@| on non-dangerspl devices i use /cache to store system dex files
12:24       NCommander | cyanogen: fair enough, but DangerSPL can lead to brick city saidly. I semi-bricked my G1 when I flashed it, and had to wipe the full NAND to get it working again
12:24         cyanogen@| so that saves about 30mb on /data
12:24         brinstar | lemme check right now
12:24         cyanogen@| i actually bricked a g1 with it
12:24        thedudeTM+| it's not a brick if you can get into the bootloader NCommander
12:25         cyanogen@| but it's pretty idiotproof now
12:25       NCommander | cyanogen: how full are /system and /data?
12:25       NCommander | thedudeTM: it won't accept a flash
12:25       NCommander | thedudeTM: failed to write everytime
12:25            prash@| that sounds liek a nand corruption
12:25         brinstar | yay it is
12:25        thedudeTM+| well in the wiki we should tell them how to fastboot erase system and fastboot erase userdata
12:25         cyanogen@| since i decided to go for dangerspl it's less stripped down now
12:25       NCommander | prash: possibly. I fixed it with fastboot boot into recovery, and dd
12:25         cyanogen@| actually includes more than one ringtone
12:25       NCommander | thedudeTM: that didn't help :-/
12:25       NCommander | cyanogen: ahahahah
12:25         |Jason8| | cyanogen: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=6259996&postcount=2 << 164MB ROM fitting on G1
12:26         |Jason8| | with HardSPL/ENG
12:26            prash@| ew app_s
12:26       NCommander | cyanogen: maybe a silly quesiton, but can't we override the partition layout with the kernel alone though?
12:26         cyanogen@| yeah i don't wanna fuck with that
12:26            prash@| thats haykuro hacks, do not want
12:26            kmobs+| app_s is lame
12:26       NCommander | cyanogen: the kernel passes in mtdparts from the SPL. We coud ljust ignore it
12:26         cyanogen@| no, the mtd stuff is hardcoded in the spl
12:26  mode/#cyanogenmod [+v koush] by ChanServ
12:27       NCommander | cyanogen: but doesn't it have to be passed into the kernel? The kernel has autodetection code for MTD, but all it sees is one giant NAND chip
12:27          Sturmeh | lol i fail, i tried compiling the git dump and i just got "Hello World, cyanogenmod!"
12:27          Sturmeh | <_<
12:27       NCommander | replace the autodetection and you can repartition freely
12:27          ecarp84 | Anyone know how to fix the gtalk disconnects on mytouch running cyanogenmod
12:27           UX-Guy | cyanogen looking at your xml, it looks like you open 2 framelayouts but only close 1 of them
12:27         cyanogen@| yeah but i don't believe you can repartition it
12:27         brinstar | do you dev guys use ubuntu to compile?
12:27             zinx@| cyanogen: we can actually change the partitions around pretty easy via the kernel command line
12:27          Sturmeh | brinstar doesn't matter it's java
12:27             zinx@| cyanogen: the rub is, fastboot flash will no longer work right
12:28          Sturmeh | oh
12:28          Sturmeh | well
12:28         cyanogen@| yeah i really don't wanna use weird hacks
12:28          Sturmeh | not really
12:28          Sturmeh | :P
12:28         cyanogen@| just install dangerspl
12:28       NCommander | zinx: well, for !recovery/boot
12:28             zinx@| cyanogen: agree :D
12:28         cyanogen@| the g1 is like 1.5 years old now
12:28       NCommander | cyanogen: we're just giving you options if we want to avoid dagnerspl :-)
12:28            bri3d | brinstar: I'm on Ubuntu, people use whatever Linux distro they like though
12:28       logomancer | I've heard that DangerSPL fucks up the hw keyboard.
12:28         brinstar | yeah, i guess linux is the main req
12:28         cyanogen@| logomancer:  nah
12:28         |Jason8| | logomancer: I've got danger and there's no issue with the hardware keyboard
12:28          Sturmeh | zinx is death and danger spl the same?
12:28        thedudeTM+| where do all these strange dangerspl rumors come from
12:28         |Jason8| | Actually, there aren't any issues at all
12:29            bri3d | I've heard that DangerSPL fucks up your mother
12:29            prash@| i see the two framelayouts too, main one doesn't close
12:29       logomancer | Heard it here last night, dude.
12:29       NCommander | logomancer: it fucks up non-QWERTYkeyboards
12:29       logomancer | Ah.
12:29         cyanogen@| probably every g1 on earth has the new radio now anyway
12:29           UX-Guy | cyanogen you didn't close the lockPattern frameLayout
12:29       logomancer | So I should be fine then.
12:29         cyanogen@| so flashing the new spl is no problem
12:29          ecarp84 | cyanogen: running 4.2.15.1 i cannot turn off 360 rotation. the option doesnt toggle it. been like this since i flashed it when that patch came out but worked on 4.2.15
12:29            prash@| cyanogen: exactly
12:29       NCommander | but only in recovery
12:29         -!- thedudeTM is now known as thedood|away
12:29           Tr0jAn | I just flashed my G1 with danger.spl ready for your CM
12:29          Sturmeh | cyanogen new being RADIO-2.22.19.26I?
12:29          Sturmeh | D:
12:29       NCommander | cyanogen: oh well, there's all my crackpottery :-)
12:30          Sturmeh | Tr0jAn did u end up wiping?
12:30            prash@| only issue i can see with dangerspl is if they downgrade to rc29 and flash dangerspl before updating the radio
12:30           Tr0jAn | nope
12:30            bri3d | ^ yeah
12:30       logomancer | There's also 2.22.23.02 for T-Mo, which also works.
12:30           Tr0jAn | I did a nandroid
12:30           Tr0jAn | flashed spl
12:30           Tr0jAn | restored
12:30         brinstar | another thing on my mind regarding android in general, was the 10mb ram hack, wouldn't it slow down the phone overall, since its taking away RAM from the GPU?
12:30          Sturmeh | that works fine?
12:30            prash@| but if they can't read all the warnings, then they deserve bricks when rooting :P
12:30         *     PsychoI3oy just restored his nandroid after flashing danger
12:30         cyanogen@| do we have a wiki article on dangerspl?
12:30       PsychoI3oy@| it's booting
12:30            bri3d | basically if they are not retarded they will not brick
12:30       PsychoI3oy@| cyanogen, yes, as of last night
12:30       NCommander | prash: what we need is a special update.zip that does radio and spl together
12:30            prash@| we have a forum thread
12:30           Tr0jAn | Sturmeh I think so ;)
12:30       logomancer | We had a stub last night.
12:30         cyanogen@| nice
12:30       PsychoI3oy@| ciwrl|afk, and someone else wrote it
12:30            prash@| NCommander: that'd be swell
12:31          Sturmeh | Tr0jAn well did it retain any hacks u had?
12:31         *     PsychoI3oy has that in his rss feed
12:31       PsychoI3oy@| also: damn, my splash2 went away after flashing danger
12:31 BUGabundo_remote | cyanogen: and what about Magic? no spl change need, right?
12:31       PsychoI3oy@| that's right, mt3gs only get splash1
12:31          Sturmeh | yea PsychoI3oy it has that effect
12:31          Sturmeh | :P
12:31           Tr0jAn | not sure as I let it reboot then updated my rom.. but it seems the same
12:31       NCommander | prash: well I'd have to make sure recovery flashs radio first, THEN hboot
12:31          Sturmeh | but did it change ur splash1?
12:31        underdog` | So the SPL is dependent on the radio version, right?
12:31      BlackBishop | cyan I have 2.22.23.02 and Dspl ..
12:31           Tr0jAn | yes
12:31           Tr0jAn | ahh O
12:31       PsychoI3oy@| Sturmeh, no, it's still my silly splash1
12:31           Tr0jAn | NO
12:31           Tr0jAn | lol
12:31       PsychoI3oy@| splash2 was more fun to look at
12:31          Sturmeh | haha
12:32          Sturmeh | sigh my splash 2 is better aswell
12:32          Sturmeh | :(
12:32          Sturmeh | it goes HTC
12:32          Sturmeh | then HTC DREAM
12:32            prash@| http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/index.php/DangerSPL nice
12:32          Sturmeh | :P
12:32            prash@| it has content now
12:32 BUGabundo_remote | PsychoI3oy: splah1?
12:32            prash@| cyanogen: btw we have 4-5 mirrors for the gapps too
12:33       PsychoI3oy@| BUGabundo_remote, on g1 there's actually two splash screens for the boot before the animated one
12:33           tahnok | there should be a how do i know if i already have dangerspl section
12:33       PsychoI3oy@| BUGabundo_remote, stock only has one of them flashed so it stays on the TmobG1 logo till aniboot, engy/hard spl can flash splash1 and splash2
12:33       PsychoI3oy@| magics only have one, though
12:33            prash@| tahnok, i suppose thats true
12:33       PsychoI3oy@| and since dangerspl is a magic spl with hax, i lose splash2
12:33           bcrook+| koush: So your universal update.zip does or doesnt work on DS?
12:34            koush+| bcrook: it might
12:34       logomancer | cyanogen: I wonder what would happen if you explicitly set the padding in the FrameLayout to 0...
12:34         brinstar | if we are coming to CM from a different rom, do we still need to flash the defanged base rom?
12:34            koush+| bcrook: but probably not, becaues my shit isnt compiled for arm
12:34         tinktank | hi all
12:34            kmobs+| koush: I think you have to fix the base don't you?
12:34            koush+| kmobs: no
12:34       PsychoI3oy@| /dev/block/mtdblock3     90.0M     62.0M     28.0M  69% /system
12:34       PsychoI3oy@| there she is
12:34            koush+| kmobs: the base is extracted magically
12:34           tahnok | prash: it's just if the second line of fastboot is 1.33.2005?
12:34            kmobs+| oh you fixedit?
12:34       PsychoI3oy@| and all my stuff is still there
12:34            kmobs+| nice
12:34           bcrook+| koush: Nice. Cause I could release a port now...
12:34            prash@| .2005 is dangerspl
12:34         brinstar | im on openeclair at present
12:35            prash@| brinstar: current versions yes you have to do 2 flashes for cyanogenmod
12:35       PsychoI3oy@| oh, wow, the bootloader screen looks different
12:35       logomancer | Hmm...I wonder how OE solved this lockscreen problem...
12:35       PsychoI3oy@| still skating androids but smaller text, interesting
12:35            prash@| the dangerspl had extra stuff in bootloader
12:36         brinstar | prash: thanks
12:36           tahnok | so as long as it end in .2005 it's danger?
12:36            prash@| i believe so
12:36          Sturmeh | PsychoI3oy since when were there skating androids?
12:36         |Jason8| | yeah
12:36       PsychoI3oy@| yeah, a menu
12:36         *        Sturmeh thinks ur nandroid failed?
12:36            prash@| PsychoI3oy: you forgot progress bars when you flash stuff
12:36       PsychoI3oy@| Sturmeh, uh, skating androids in the spl/bootloader/fastboot screen are standard for everything but stock g1 SPL
12:37          Sturmeh | :P
12:37          blunden | PsychoI3oy: you've never used DangerSPL before?
12:37          Sturmeh | where does this bootloader
12:37          Sturmeh | occur
12:37          Sturmeh | D:
12:37       PsychoI3oy@| Sturmeh, just to spite you, i'm flashing CM 5.0.7 DS now
12:37       PsychoI3oy@| so :-p
12:37            prash@| haha
12:37          Sturmeh | NO U
12:37       NCommander | PsychoI3oy: your G1 is getting all fancy
12:37            Assid | PsychoI3oy: dangerspl ?
12:37       PsychoI3oy@| never had to before
12:37         *        Sturmeh falls out of PsychoI3oy's airvent.
12:37            prash@| http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/index.php?/topic/2646-how-to-danger-spl/
12:37          Sturmeh | ouch
12:38            prash@| we got forum and wiki ready it seems
12:38            koush+| bcrook: the zip will work, the problem is that the binaries i released with the zip are compiled for armv7
12:38       PsychoI3oy@| Sturmeh, if you can fit in my air vents you're about 4" wide and i can break you in half with one arm
12:38            prash@| we got mirrors for extras zip
12:38          blunden | PsychoI3oy: were you running HardSPL before or didn't you even have fastboot flash?
12:38       PsychoI3oy@| blunden, hardspl since I rooted in Feb of last year
12:38            prash@| PsychoI3oy lived in the stone ages
12:38         cyanogen@| i should fix the camera glitch too
12:38            koush+| bcrook: so, if they were to be recompiled for arm generic, it would work on any device
12:38          Sturmeh | guys changing radio on hardspl can't be dangerous amirite?
12:38       PsychoI3oy@| back when dangerspl was earning its moniker
12:38            prash@| DangerSPL so easy a caveman can do it
12:39         cyanogen@| where the snapped picture is garbage in the preview pane
12:39          blunden | ok, I flashed DangerSPL to my magic pretty much instantly because I couldn't stand the Vodafone splash
12:39           bcrook+| koush: easy to do?
12:39            prash@| i got garbage then it shows actual picture cyanogen
12:39         cyanogen@| theres no dangerspl for magic
12:39          Sturmeh | blunden u can flash teh splash images
12:39         cyanogen@| or at least you don't need one
12:39          Sturmeh | oh and yea
12:39          Sturmeh | lol
12:39       PsychoI3oy@| blunden, you fail
12:39            koush+| bcrook: you could just try it and see if it works :p
12:39     robotfactory | Does Fastboot list the SPL version?
12:39            koush+| bcrook: if it doesn't i can fixit
12:39          Sturmeh | yes robotfactory
12:40          Sturmeh | whats urssay
12:40       PsychoI3oy@| robotfactory, yes, as 'HBOOT '
12:40          Sturmeh | HSPL10.95.3000
12:40       PsychoI3oy@| (or HSPL on hardspl)
12:40          Sturmeh | i'm cool
12:40          Sturmeh | i have hardspl
12:40          blunden | cyanogen: it's the same, but I needed an engineering SPL so no reason not to use that one
12:40          Sturmeh | i don't even remember how i got it
12:40            koush+| bcrook: actually i might even be able to build with ndk, that wuold be handy
12:40          Sturmeh | D:
12:40            koush+| '
12:40          blunden | PsychoI3oy: how so?
12:40       PsychoI3oy@| blunden, 'danger on magic'
12:40          blunden | works perfectly on my old phone and running a custom splash
12:40     robotfactory | 'cause I could have sworn I flashed Danger on my magic a few weeks after launch but, apparently, that's not possible beacuse it doesn't exist.
12:40            Assid | cyanogen: so it ready for prodution use?
12:41       PsychoI3oy@| well, i guess it could work, it is a magic spl afterall
12:41          blunden | PsychoI3oy: sure there is no "danger" in doing it but it's the same file
12:41          blunden | yes, it works perfectly
12:41       PsychoI3oy@| blunden, hmm
12:41          blunden | I thought that was common knowledge
12:41       PsychoI3oy@| nevermind then
12:41          Sturmeh | waah
12:41         *     PsychoI3oy never gave much thought to dangerspl because the only reason to get it was H*** roms and I don't want noneofthat
12:41          blunden | this just proves what I said about people in general knowing jack-shit about the Magic
12:41        commodoor | Hi everyone
12:41          blunden | :(
12:42            Ronen | http://get.skyfire.com/dl_android.php Sexy...server side flash conversion :D
12:42          ecarp84 | one question about CM5 for dream/magic? wipe required or no?
12:42        commodoor | now its more populated here maybe i can ask something
12:42       logomancer | ecarp84, more than likely
12:42        commodoor | did someone noticed on his N1 that the market was slow?
12:42          Sturmeh | should we really be using G1-radio-2_22_23_02.zip ?
12:42       PsychoI3oy@| haha, love the boot message cyanogen
12:42            prash@| if youre on tmobile thats the latest
12:42          Sturmeh | it's not on here -> http://developer.htc.com/adp.html D:
12:42          Sturmeh | ah tmobile
12:43          blunden | Sturmeh: no reason not to, I use that with DangerSPL
12:43         tinktank | quick question, if i'm going to be going from 4.2.15.1 to 5.x, do i need to flash a radio again when i change to danger spl?
12:43          Sturmeh | blunden shh ur magic
12:43            prash@| http://forum.cyanogenmod.com/index.php?/topic/2646-how-to-danger-spl/ tinktank
12:43          Sturmeh | it's SafeSPL for u
12:43            prash@| you should have latest radio anyway tinktank
12:43       PsychoI3oy@| http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/index.php/DangerSPL
12:43         tinktank | prash: reading it but can't find a definitive answer
12:43          Sturmeh | i'm just wondering why it's not on the dev page
12:43          Sturmeh | that's all
12:43          Sturmeh | :P
12:43       PsychoI3oy@| hmm
12:43       PsychoI3oy@| we're gonna need new upgrade pages for everything
12:43            prash@| tinktank: you're on latest rom, chances are you have a 2.x radio
12:44            prash@| so you dont need to flash it
12:44         tinktank | ok then, so i just flash danger spl?
12:44            prash@| as long as your baseband version says 2.x
12:44          Sturmeh | yea just
12:44          blunden | tinktank: just check your baseband version in settings
12:44            prash@| flash dangerspl and flash the current rom again (including the base if youre flashing .15.1
12:44         -!- otubo[AFK] is now known as otubo
12:44          Sturmeh | prash when u say 2.x do u mean RADIO-2.22.19.26I
12:44          Sturmeh | or anything that starts with 2?
12:44          Sturmeh | or one that's compatible with eclair
12:45            prash@| baseband in the settings>about
12:45          Sturmeh | ahk
12:45     robotfactory | Reading the DangerSPL wiki page it sounds like my n00b self was lucky not to brick my phone when I flashed it. Holy crap.
12:45       PsychoI3oy@| wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwow this boot is taking a while
12:45            kmobs+| yeah PsychoI3oy
12:45            kmobs+| oh
12:45            kmobs+| and...
12:45       logomancer | cyanogen, with that lockscreen, could there be a right padding or right margin someplace?
12:45          Sturmeh | prash mine says 62.50S.20.17U_2.22.19.26I
12:45       PsychoI3oy@| I think i see new-apps2sd-hax happening
12:45            prash@| strumeh you have 26I which is a 2.x radio
12:45            prash@| 2.22.19.26i
12:45          Sturmeh | yea thought so
12:46            kmobs+| PsychoI3oy: you're gonn ahave to copy your dalvik-cache back into data and symlink it
12:46          Sturmeh | i'm just wondering if i should risk updating it
12:46            kmobs+| if you wanna use the market
12:46            prash@| kmobs i didnt have to do all that
12:46          Sturmeh | kmobs i'd delete it
12:46          Sturmeh | and make a new symlink
12:46          blunden | prash: still though, the tmobile radio update works just fine and improves reception so I don't see why people don't use it
12:46          DeuX-PT | my spider senses are catching up allot of drama in the future
12:46       PsychoI3oy@| kmobs, only if i want to download HUGE crap
12:46            kmobs+| prash: look at your busybox df -h
12:46            prash@| blunden: no clue
12:47          Sturmeh | blunden i'm not on tmobile
12:47            kmobs+| PsychoI3oy: not really.  Only if you wanna download stuff thats bigger than ~1mb
12:47       PsychoI3oy@| oh wow that notification is both music to my ears and annoying as fuck
12:47          Sturmeh | it's not here -> http://developer.htc.com/adp.html
12:47          Sturmeh | it's compatible
12:47          Sturmeh | i'm sticking with I
12:47          Sturmeh | :P
12:47       PsychoI3oy@| kmobs, i'm running today's build, i thought he changed dalvik to not be on /cache on dangerspl?
12:47            kmobs+| oh maybe
12:47            kmobs+| I dunno
12:47            kmobs+| I haven't loaded github today
12:47          Sturmeh | PsychoI3oy u can't put them on cache, won't fit
12:47          Sturmeh | D:
12:47          Sturmeh | symlink it to data
12:47          ecarp84 | how do i check if cm is using my swap
12:48          Sturmeh | or sd
12:48           bcrook+| koush: How would I go about doing it
12:48          ecarp84 | anyone know a easy terminal command?
12:48            prash@| dont listen to kmobs, he's just trying to sound smart
12:48          Sturmeh | ecarp84 type free
12:48            prash@| ls ecarp84
12:48       Codenomics | prash: damn you!
12:48          Haraken | what is the defanged base?  does that include the googly bits we need?
12:48         *          kmobs slaps prash
12:48          ecarp84 | thanks
12:48       Codenomics | that was the command i was going to suggest
12:48          Sturmeh | how does ls <_<
12:49           UX-Guy | ecarp84 from adb you do 'adb shell free'
12:49          Sturmeh | .. /\
12:49       PsychoI3oy@| Haraken, yes, it contains the googlybits for CM 4.2.x
12:49      BlackBishop | will cmupdater see cm5 in the update list ?
12:49          Sturmeh | is defanged base just the htc image without the nazi recovery flasher?
12:49       PsychoI3oy@| BlackBishop, I don't see why not
12:50       PsychoI3oy@| Sturmeh, yes, and no boot.img or radio.img
12:50          ecarp84 | okay if cm isnt using my swap. any ideas to fix it
12:50          Sturmeh | ahk
12:50          Haraken | PsychoI3oy, thanks
12:50      BlackBishop | well, they should get a warning .. if they don't have dspl ...
12:50            prash@| ecarp84: research into 'swapon' command
12:50            prash@| cm doesn't need swap to run so it doesnt automatically turn it on
12:50          Sturmeh | BlackBishop i assume it's going to be a little hard to facilitate a spl change and wipe etc over cm updater
12:50       PsychoI3oy@| heh, i'm running fix_permissions and the phone just restarted the runtime
12:51          Sturmeh | yay
12:51           Chopes | http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/29/skyfire-2-0-now-ready-to-set-android-ablaze/ : Firstly, the Video link serves as a workaround for those pesky "your phone ain't got no Flash" missives by doing server-side conversions of Flash video into universally comprehensible formats like HTML5
12:51           Chopes | anyone try this out yet?
12:51           Chopes | seems promissing
12:51       PsychoI3oy@| good thing i'm running it from adb shell
12:51          ecarp84 | Okay. Im mainly having a problem with my google talk always disconnecting messing up my google apps being sync'd and market downloading
12:51          Sturmeh | Chopes moar promicing things in here atm
12:51          ecarp84 | I read that swap being on can fix that
12:51      BlackBishop | Sturmeh: yes, but they should still get a warning "if you don't have dspl .. it won't work !"
12:51      BlackBishop | or something
12:51           Chopes | Sturmeh: wana share with chopes? :P
12:51          Sturmeh | BlackBishop u'd have to wipe anyway
12:51          Sturmeh | Chopes cm5 for g1/magic
12:52           Chopes | I have a n1 :P
12:52          Sturmeh | then have fun with ur skyfire
12:52          Sturmeh | :)
12:52          Sturmeh | u should try fennec for lulz
12:52         *         Chopes is lost.
12:52          ecarp84 | im going to try reflashing 4.2.15.1 over itself and see if it happens to fix my issues first
12:52          Sturmeh | Firefox for android
12:53           Chopes | o
12:53       PsychoI3oy@| ecarp84, re-flashing defanged and CM has been known to help such issues; clearing data for 'google apps' in settings->applications->manage applications also helps
12:53         brinstar | is it true that FF on android cant be installed because its too big?
12:53         brinstar | *on g1
12:54          Sturmeh | it's just not compiled for 2.0
12:54          Sturmeh | eh
12:54          Sturmeh | 1.6
12:54       Codenomics | CM might not need /swap, but why not use it anyway?
12:54         mjoffers | hmm... is cm 5.07 cumming ? or ?
12:54          Sturmeh | and i'm sure theres not enough memory
12:54          Sturmeh | yes all over ur mum mjoffers
12:54         -!- thedood|away is now known as thedudeTM
12:54       Codenomics | a swap partition would only help
12:54          ecarp84 | PsychoI3oy, thanks. ill try those. i also get to keep all my installed apps and settings when reflashing those over the top right?
12:54          Sturmeh | no swap
12:54          Sturmeh | swap is evil
12:55          Sturmeh | u want speed use JIT cuz it's hardcore
12:55          Sturmeh | :P
12:55       PsychoI3oy@| ecarp84, yes
12:55       Codenomics | why is swap evil?
12:55          Sturmeh | well it's not really necessary
12:55     robotfactory | Can trash your SD card, too.
12:55          Sturmeh | unless you want to keep a bilion apps open
12:55          Sturmeh | and still define open
12:55          kslater | swap can be evil in the environment of a phone with SD mounted as disk
12:55          Sturmeh | it just remembers state is all
12:56         -!- Weust` is now known as Weust`afk
12:56       Codenomics | ok
12:56     robotfactory | I don't know, swap might be useful if you've somehow managed to open some really ginormious files.
12:56       Codenomics | didnt realize it could harm SD
12:56            kmobs+| everyone should google 2.1 cyanogenmod 5.0.7
12:56            kmobs+| its ridiculous
12:56         brinstar | does ext2 cause less wear on the sd card than ext3/4?
12:57          Sturmeh | maybe?
12:57          Sturmeh | but use ext3
12:57     robotfactory | Codenomics, Flash memory has a finite number of write cycles. Since swap would write a lot to the card you'll wear through it quicker.
12:57         brinstar | since theres no journaling
12:57       Codenomics | robotfactory: that makes sense
12:57          Sturmeh | trust me without journaling lifes a bitch
12:57           shugav | is it true there is cyanogen mod 5.06 Android 2.1 for Magic ?
12:57          blunden | shugav: no, no 5.0.6
12:57      canadiancow | no
12:57          Sturmeh | shugav not 5.06 but cm5 yea soon
12:58         brinstar | i didnt use ext2 for long until i upgraded to ext3, but from what i could tell, it didnt fuck up too much
12:58           shugav | nice
12:58       Codenomics | wow according to EVERY web site out there CM 5.0.7 is due out today!
12:58     robotfactory | Codenomics, it also would probably even slow your device down unless you're using a Class 6 card. Even then the read/write speeds aren't anywhere near close to what the on-board memory can do.
12:58          Sturmeh | due out?
12:58          Sturmeh | wtf is that supposed to mean
12:58          Sturmeh | noone is due to do anything
12:58         cyanogen@| NCommander:  ping
12:59          Sturmeh | pong
12:59       NCommander | cyanogen: pong
12:59         cyanogen@| got a weird camera glitch
12:59       NCommander | cyanogen: !\o/!
12:59       Codenomics | Sturmeh: i was talking about what the interwebs are saying
12:59       NCommander | cyanogen: what's the glitch?
12:59            kmobs+| virtually no one has commented on the bewbs in the video.  I guess people came to the 2.1 instead
12:59         cyanogen@| when you snap the photo, it focuses, and snaps, and the preview turns to garbage
12:59          Sturmeh | lol i know Codenomics
12:59          Sturmeh | just saying
12:59         cyanogen@| but the picture is taken ok
12:59           shugav | i have heard that htere is Android 2.2 for Magic
12:59           shugav | here http://htcpedia.com/news/htc_android_magic_hero.html
12:59         cyanogen@| i'm looking at the pmem heaps its using
12:59          Sturmeh | shugav u has be trollin?
12:59         cyanogen@| not sure what's going on
13:00         cyanogen@| ever see that?
13:00       NCommander | cyanogen: hrm, very odd.
13:00       Codenomics | lol @ "yeah, I am wearing the pink hat"
13:00          Sturmeh | cyanogen how garbage we talking?
13:00       NCommander | cyanogen: it sounds like there might have been a change in behavior in the way the camera APIs are called from 2.0->2.1->2.1update1
13:00       bluenazgul | any1 can help me to get the google bits for CM5.0.7 for G1/MT3G plese?
13:00         cyanogen@| yeah but i fixed most of that afaik
13:01          Sturmeh | bluenazgul it's not out yet

13:01          Haraken | xD
13:01       bluenazgul | i know, i only want to get the gapps
13:01          Sturmeh | bluenazgul i'm pretty sure they'll change for 2.0
13:01       NCommander | cyanogen: fixed what? It used to work fine on 2.0 and 2.1 AOSP

13:02       NCommander | fuck
13:02         brinstar | what i think is most awesome about this 5.0.6 release is that i no longer need to upgrade to N1 :)
13:02          Sturmeh | who said 5.0.6
13:02         cyanogen@| yeah
13:02          Sturmeh | and it's not a relase yet
13:02         brinstar | i might buy a new car with the money i saved
13:02         cyanogen@| but it's just when generating that final snap to show in the preview
13:02         brinstar | *5.0.7
13:02          Sturmeh | i'll just go get caught speeding
13:03         cyanogen@| it actually takes the picture just fine
13:03          Sturmeh | oh wait i already did
13:03           shugav | do I need a CPU overclocking app , for CM 4.2.15  , or the os has one build in ?
13:03         cyanogen@| hrm this might be in the framework
13:04         -!- kmobs is now known as kmobsHAT
13:04          blunden | shugav: I'm sure it will run 528 MHz maximum, ie. not downclocked
13:04          blunden | not overclocked though
13:05     robotfactory | Even SetCPU won't let you push it past 528MHz.
13:05          Haraken | soulashell, ah here it goes
13:05          Haraken | very nice
13:05          TrisMcC | blunden: My phone was underclocked with CM 4.2.15.1
13:05           Eugiaz | cyanogen: the optichrager tool you added in vendor runs automatically after building, or does it need to be run manually?
13:05     robotfactory | I run at 528MHz on my MT3G and it's smooth as butta.
13:05           shugav | robotfactory:  but the battery suck
13:05          ecarp84 | i use setcpu to downclock it if the battery gets too low in hopes of keeping the phone on long enough to get to the charger if im at work or ie
13:05          TrisMcC | speaking of SetCPU, does anyone else get prompted to re-buy it upon update?
13:05          ecarp84 | i haven't
13:06     robotfactory | shugav, yes it does. But I'm not a very mobile person. I'm always near a USB port.
13:06       NCommander | cyanogen: it might be entering snapshot mode too early which would fuzz up the image preview
13:06          ecarp84 | usb port charges so slowww
13:06           shugav | yes

13:06          Sturmeh | i mean if ur doing more in less time it isn't going to use more battery doing the same stuff
13:07          Haraken | soulashell, yeah it worked after I reloaded the page...
13:07       NCommander | cyanogen: very strange. copybilt usually fails when its getting an invalid memory address or bad content
13:07       soulashell | redtube?
13:07          Haraken | yup
13:07          Haraken | can videos be fast forwarded?
13:07       soulashell | lol
13:07            bri3d | lol @ redtube
13:07       NCommander | cyanogen: but pmem has to be setup correctly else previews won't work at all
13:07          wergeld | boom shakalak
13:07         cyanogen@| ohh
13:07         cyanogen@| theres no destination format set
13:07         cyanogen@| (i think)
13:07           shugav | Sturmeh:  you have a poin ,  but when you lock the screen you do not need 528Mhz  you need 128Mhz : I will there was a downloacking option on screen off
13:07       soulashell | Haraken: i don't think so, i couldn't
13:07       NCommander | cyanogen: ah, sounds like an API change then
13:07          Haraken | ah well, this is still amazing
13:08       Boldfilter | HEY KINGCLICK ALREADY HAS 2.1 ROM
13:08         mjoffers | redtube = pron ?
13:08          Haraken | finally porn on my phone, how long I've waited for this feature
13:08       soulashell | Haraken: hopefully in later releases
13:08            bri3d | mjoffers: correct
13:08          wergeld | no yelling!
13:08          blunden | TrisMcC: then you are doing it wrong, because it should scale to 528 MHz
13:08          Haraken | hehe
13:08         cyanogen@| there are so many layers of abstraction to the camera
13:08       logomancer | You want porn, fuck off to Android...wait...
13:08            bri3d | Boldfilter: he totally has an xperia rom on nexus one too
13:08            bri3d | he just "can't figure out the buttons"
13:08       NCommander | cyanogen: the Android camera layer was crack. It took longer to figure out how it works then it did to reverse engineer the structs
13:08          Sturmeh | shugav it doesn't matter and you can do that with setcpu
13:08       NCommander | s/was/is/g
13:08            bri3d | god that guy is a toolbox
13:08          Sturmeh | Boldfilter lol, I want a rom that works
13:08       PsychoI3oy@| wergeld, why did you need full admin rights on the google code site again?
13:09       Boldfilter | lol
13:09       Boldfilter | thats nice too
13:09       NCommander | cyanogen: and its completely undocumented for 2.x
13:09       NCommander | :-)
13:09       PsychoI3oy@| i know cameron said at some point but i forget
13:09          Boggy-B | can i just get a quick clarification, cm updater says there's only one theme available (using CM 6.0.6-N1) does that mean it's the only one that will work with that version 'yet'?
13:09           shugav | Sturmeh: the problem is , or a question , does set Set CPU interfere with the CM overclocking ?
13:10          wergeld | psycho: at one point I was doing docs.
13:10          Sturmeh | CM doesn't do 'overclocking' it just defaults to a higher clock
13:10          Sturmeh | setcpu lets u change it
13:10          wergeld | that was before the wiki
13:10          Haraken | im tempted to update my spl now but I'll have my new phone tomorrow so I feel like I should wait so I don't have to redo all my settings twice
13:10           shugav | Sturmeh: i see , 10x very helpful
13:10          Sturmeh | Haraken nandroid
13:10          kslater | cyanogen: find your 4M yet? And is it even worth trying for it?
13:10          Sturmeh | good seller ++
13:11          Sturmeh | kslater no and he's using dangerspl
13:11       NCommander | cyanogen: you might want to rebuild the camera layers with debugging enabled, it should make it easier to see whats breaking
13:11          Haraken | Sturmeh, eh good point guess I should take advantage of that
13:11          Sturmeh | my only problem is it's 68mb, what goes in the rest of the 96mb of space?
13:11          kslater | Sturmeh: then I know what I have to do tonight.
13:11          wergeld | I shouldn't have full rights....wacky
13:11          Sturmeh | hurr
13:11          Sturmeh | i want to but i'm scarrred
13:11          Sturmeh | D:
13:11       logomancer | Sturmeh, 2.2, when it comes out :P
13:12          Sturmeh | logomancer 2.2 is going to be stripped down
13:12          Sturmeh | for g1
13:12          Sturmeh | oh wait maybe not
13:12          Sturmeh | we only saw it on a magic
13:12          Sturmeh | :P
13:12       logomancer | No shit, really?
13:12       Boldfilter | Kang-o-rama
13:12          Sturmeh | HURR
13:12          kslater | I'm thinking no animated wall papers for 2.1 on the D/S
13:12          kslater | phone struggles enough just running the code I ask it to
13:13       logomancer | LWPs are in, just buggy at the moment
13:13            prash@| they work but its stripped from the rom
13:13          Sturmeh | orly kslater
13:13          Sturmeh | :P
13:13            prash@| no lwp's in d/s :)
13:13          Sturmeh | no L2 either
13:13          Sturmeh | :(
13:13          Sturmeh | hehe
13:13            prash@| yeah launcher2 is not needed
13:13           UX-Guy | froyo should help with fragmentation by allowing more of the apps to be decoupled
13:13       Codenomics | LWPs are the debil on g1
13:13          Sturmeh | i'll probs be using AWD soon as he gets eclair builds sorted
13:13            prash@| all it is is a fancy 3d effect thrown into regular launcher
13:13          Sturmeh | *ADW
13:13           UX-Guy | like the way maps is
13:14         *     NCommander will be kinda suprised if the G1 one gets one official update
13:14         cyanogen@| i'm not sure if that copy is happening in libqcamera or what
13:14       logomancer | If they can make 2.2 fit...
13:14          kslater | if it got a 2.1 update OTA, I'd be surprised anyway
13:14          Sturmeh | nn guys
13:14         cyanogen@| 2.2 is gonna have a bunch of stuff unbundled
13:14          Sturmeh | i hope i wake up to epic good news
13:14          Sturmeh | :P
13:15          Sturmeh | and good luck
13:15          kslater | and then it would have the official drivers
13:15         cyanogen@| i'm pretty certain they are gonna ship it at least for the magic
13:15         cyanogen@| well 2.2
13:15       NCommander | cyanogen: no, libqcamera doesn't interact with anything beside bionic and the direct camera devices
13:15         cyanogen@| i don't know if its 2.2
13:15         cyanogen@| froyo
13:15       logomancer | Which means it may work with the G1 with DangerSPL
13:15       NCommander | cyanogen: (ldd shows it doesn't touch the Android subsystem)
13:15       Codenomics | crap, I have to root a G1 and  MT3G at school tonight
13:15       NCommander | cyanogen: what I got the impression is that QC probably has a BSP for the G1 SoC
13:16       NCommander | then HTC and Google used that blob and build the libcamera wrapper around it
13:16       NCommander | which why that is open source but libqcamera.so isn't
13:16            xkahn | setcpu is $2?!
13:16            xkahn | crazy
13:16         brinstar | what i hate most about rooting is when you get a g1 thats already on 1.6 official
13:17         brinstar | thats the most annoying thing ever
13:17       logomancer | brinstar, I had one of those.
13:17           UX-Guy | how DARE they update those to an official rom
13:17         cyanogen@| ok it's passed over the binder
13:17       Codenomics | brinstar: that is where I started
13:17         brinstar | its like 5 steps back to get 5 steps forward
13:18       Boldfilter | woah brah
13:18       Boldfilter | 5 steps?
13:18         brinstar | lol
13:18       Boldfilter | Im limited t o2 steps brah
13:18          wergeld | psychoboi I am removing myself from the 'owner' group.
13:19          wergeld | well crap that didn't work...
13:20       PsychoI3oy@| wergeld, I can do it, heh
13:20          wergeld | psycho: see if you can remove me.
13:20          wergeld | thanky
13:21          wergeld | sorry for theconfusion.
13:21       NCommander | cyanogen: what passed over binder?
13:21       NCommander | pmem?
13:22            koush+| cyanogen: what is unbundling supposed to be? from what i heard it was just removing internal framework references from the stock apps.
13:23          wergeld | not sure how I got into admin. all set now?
13:23         cyanogen@| i'm not sure where the code is that does that
13:23         cyanogen@| still looking
13:24         cyanogen@| libcamera spawns snapshot_thread and waits on it
13:24       NCommander | cyanogen: make sure you look at the dlopen's, and a lot of it is kernel space linkage
13:25            Ronen | So, Cyano 5.0.7 drop for G1/mT3G?
13:26          blunden | Ronen: when it does, you will know
13:26          blunden | trust me
13:26         *          Ronen lives in a cave :(
13:26          TrisMcC | It will be an international holiday.
13:27            Assid | any updates for n1 during 5.0.7 ?

13:29         brinstar | they finally get porn :)
13:29            Assid | arm optimizations shouldnt affect us right?
13:29          blunden | Assid: yes, it will
13:29          mdmadph | so, what about that cyano 5.0.7 drop for the G1/mT3G.
13:29          mdmadph | Is this the right room?
13:29           Nushio | yeah
13:29          mdmadph | Someone told me if you came here and gave your CC #'s you could get it
13:29            prash@| you best be jokin
13:29          blunden | Assid: they are basically optimized ASM versions of the code
13:29            prash@| yes
13:29           Nushio | if I have OpenEclair 1.3.0, and want to switch to CM5.0.7, what would I have to do?
13:30          blunden | often using NEON
13:30           Nushio | I'm already on DangerSPL
13:30            prash@| if you donate monies to my paypal you can also get it
13:30 BUGabundo_remote | Ubuntu 10.04 LTS released
13:30          mdmadph | you must be the guy they said to talk to
13:30            Assid | BUGabundo_remote: already?
13:30          wergeld | bug: yes!
13:30         brinstar | BUGabundo_remote: cool
13:30            Assid | i need to go provide bandwith
13:30          mdmadph | Too bad it had that nasty GRUB bug
13:30         brinstar | BUGabundo_remote: they got it on time this year
13:30          mdmadph | I installed the RC a few days ago, luckily I didn't have any other partitions
13:30 BUGabundo_remote | lol
13:31          mdmadph | not even swap, fuck swap, i roll RAM only
13:31          blunden | prash: I'll one-up your offer... If they donate to me, they won't get it ;)
13:31          mdmadph | I put everything into one single giant 2GB partition.
13:31         cyanogen@|  mDataCb(CAMERA_MSG_RAW_IMAGE, mRawHeap->mBuffers[0], mCallbackCookie);
13:31         brinstar | BUGabundo_remote: is it already at cdimage.ubuntu.com?
13:32          blunden | not that I would ever accept donations since I would feel dirty
13:32 BUGabundo_remote | brinstar: ubuntu.com please
13:32 BUGabundo_remote | help distrubte the load
13:32 BUGabundo_remote | don't hit main server
13:32          mdmadph | I've even installed Windows into the same partition, just right on top of Ubuntu.
13:32         brinstar | is there a torrent
13:32       Codenomics | hey look DSes are on sale at walmart!
13:32 BUGabundo_remote | yes
13:32       Codenomics | better get a new one for the new CM
13:33          blunden | :P
13:33           tahnok | http://my.releases.ubuntu.com/releases/10.04/
13:33       NCommander | cyanogen: did that fix it?
13:33       NCommander | 10.04 is about to get released :-)
13:33         brinstar | 10.04s not on main yet
13:33       NCommander | join #ubuntu-release-party if you want to see the fun
13:33       NCommander | brinstar: the images are final
13:33         brinstar | k thanks tahnok
13:34 BUGabundo_remote | tahnok: don't use direct servers
13:34 BUGabundo_remote | let the system get the closest and fastest to you
13:34           tahnok | torrent links are on there right?
13:34         cyanogen@| so whats the callback being passed ergh
13:34         brinstar | http://my.releases.ubuntu.com/releases/10.04/ubuntu-10.04-desktop-i386.iso.torrent
13:34        laermiggg | hey cyanogen - i have an idea how to make the CM5 smaller
13:34        laermiggg | you could replace the boot animation with a very low res
13:35         brinstar | http://my.releases.ubuntu.com/releases/10.04/ubuntu-10.04-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent for futuristic pplz
13:35        laermiggg | the one in kingklicks 2.1 rom e.g. is 3,5MB
13:35        laermiggg | that could save a lot
13:35          blunden | laermiggg: not worth it, just get DangerSPL
13:35         brinstar | lol kingklick
13:35         brinstar | that guy is funny
13:35       bluenazgul | i need to get market working :(
13:36       NCommander | cyanogen: wait, what?
13:36       Boldfilter | woo geek party
13:36        laermiggg | blunden     how often do you see the bootanimation?  once a month? i think it`s not worth spending 3MB on it
13:37            koush+| chrissoyars: where to fembot builds end up
13:37          blunden | laermiggg: why should the rest of us suffer just becasue you don't want to flash your SPL? :P
13:37          blunden | laermiggg: the short answer is, because it looks unpolished
13:37            Unoid | Riku I need uuu
13:37          kslater | you could put up a static image that says "You have a G1, be happy you're getting 2.1.."
13:37        thedudeTM+| koush i can answer that
13:37       NCommander | ahahahaha kslater
13:37        thedudeTM+| in a pm
13:37         brinstar | lol kslater
13:38            koush+| thedudeTM: k
13:38        laermiggg | is making a boot-animation easy?
13:38       Boldfilter | "Get a new phone"
13:38          mdmadph | Kind sucks for people in contract.
13:38         brinstar | "You can download porn on this phone"
13:38            Unoid | I'm having weird random problem with my N1, its plugge dinto USB and it keeps resetting its USB conenction , can't mount the card to computer, but it works on phone
13:38          blunden | kslater: how about a link to google.com/phone
13:38       Boldfilter | "Get a new phone, last chance"
13:39          kslater | I'll take any of the above
13:39          kslater | or if it requires DangerSPL, I'll deal. It's a choice after all. No one's forcing anybody to move.
13:40       Boldfilter | "Next update @ google.com/phone
13:40       Boldfilter | "
13:40        laermiggg | i just thought it might be a good idea to use a small bootanimation because noone will "suffer" from that and it would be great for users who dont like to do the dangerSPL or can`t (wrong board version) without bricking
13:41         brinstar | do most ppl really watch the boot animation? i kinda agree with laermiggg
13:41       Boldfilter | bottanimations arnt hard if you know what your doing
13:41          kslater | but does shoe-horning in, just below the "it fits" threshold, mask other problems to come?
13:41          blunden | laermiggg: they can change it themselves and resign it then
13:41          blunden | not really that hard if you take your time to learn it once
13:42       Boldfilter | you can change boot with metamorph
13:42          mdmadph | damn, when yuo buy a phone online and get a number ported, they do that shit quick
13:42          blunden | Boldfilter: yeah, but that implies that those of us running DangerSPL since forever have to do it
13:42         brinstar | but if its because ppl are too lazy to dangerspl it, thats kinda dumb
13:42          blunden | not the other way around
13:42            Unoid | No one with ideas about my phone keeping beepign at me telling usb connected, isntead of just once?
13:43       Boldfilter | idk, I have mt3g
13:43            Chahk | Hello all
13:43          blunden | Unoid: grab a logcat
13:43         -!- EugeneKaway is now known as EugeneKay
13:43            Unoid | care to refresh me how
13:43            Unoid | whats comamnd
13:43          blunden | laermiggg: don't get me wrong though, if really needed it would have been a good idea :)
13:43  seraphimserapis | hello everyone
13:43       Boldfilter | Anyone trying this ubuntu 10.04
13:44         brinstar | mdmadph: youre in Italy? they take 3 days in the UK
13:44            Chahk | Is Steve here?  What are his thoughts on the under-volted kernels?
13:44  seraphimserapis | someone here knowing how to not use the backup service from google (android market)?
13:44            Unoid | I'm here but the big steve aint
13:44        laermiggg | i red that cyanogen is still trying to make it small so maybe it is a good idea
13:44          blunden | Unoid: adb logcat or logcat > /sdcard/anyfilename if you want to do it on the phone
13:44          mdmadph | brinstar: oh no, the US.
13:45          blunden | in the second case you have to manually CTRL+C it though or it will go on forever
13:45         brinstar | mdmadph: k
13:45          blunden | Chahk: 5.0.6 already runs an UVed kernel
13:45            Unoid | blund does it store to file or only output
13:45          blunden | just a more compatible one than the most extreme ones
13:46         brinstar | the UKs mobile market is stinky
13:46          blunden | Unoid: which one of the methods?
13:46            Unoid | adb logcat
13:46         brinstar | weak regulation mostly
13:46            Unoid | while i c:/
13:46            Unoid | in
13:46          blunden | Unoid: no, it will just show it in the terminal
13:46            Chahk | blunden: really?  what about the other ones, e.g. pershoot's
13:47            Unoid | mount listener is sawing 112>: handleevent ums_connected, then disabled, then disconnect, then connect
13:47          blunden | Unoid: logcat > /sdcard/filename will give you a file named filename on your sdcard with the output saved
13:47            Unoid | it keeps repeating this at weird intervals
13:47            Unoid | I cna't get it to mount to share tho lol
13:48          blunden | oh, not even in recovery?
13:48            Unoid | lemme try
13:48            Unoid | almost forgot how to get to recovery on n1 lol
13:49          blunden | Unoid: just figure that since the recovery is actually using a different kernel etc. it might work better in your case
13:50         cyanogen@| I/CameraService(  590): dataCallback(128)
13:50         cyanogen@| E/copybit (  118): copyBits failed (Invalid argument)
13:50         cyanogen@| ok so this can probably be fixed
13:51       bluenazgul | i need the passion_gapps.zip working for dream with cm please
13:51            Unoid | in ra's 1.6.2 recovery I chose the USB-MS option and the sdcard isn't showing
13:51            Unoid | but my devices shows N! is connected throguh usb
13:52           Fox_1_ | people I have 2.22.19.26I radio on G1 if I will install DengerSPL is it possible that my phone will
13:52           Fox_1_ | brick?
13:52          blunden | Unoid: mounting the sdcard through the dropdown does nothing?
13:52       Codenomics | Fox_1_: yes it is possible
13:52           Fox_1_ | :(
13:52          kslater | Fox_1_: have you looked at the DangerSPL page on the cm wiki?
13:52            Unoid | blund I'm gonna pop my card and plug it into my netbook see if it mounts there
13:52          blunden | Fox_1_: very unlikely though
13:52       Codenomics | Fox_1_: you are taking a risk with all this fun geek stuff
13:53       Codenomics | odds are you will be fine
13:53          blunden | Fox_1_: your radio is the required radio, that much we can say :)
13:53           Fox_1_ | but CM5 wouldn't work on G1 without DangerSPL. right?
13:53        laermiggg | i have the very new 2.22.23.02 radio        is that one compatible with the SPL, too?
13:53          kslater | so far Fox_1_ you are correct
13:53          kslater | needs DangerSPL
13:53       bluenazgul | cyanogen is working on this
13:54           Fox_1_ | so, if I will update radio to 2.22.23.02
13:54          blunden | bluenazgul: well, the current message is that it will require it
13:54       Codenomics | i thought the final verdict was CM5 will require it
13:54           Fox_1_ | can I install DangerSPL?
13:54       bluenazgul | i know
13:55          blunden | Fox_1_: I would think so since I'm running that SPL on my Magic with that radio with 0 issues
13:55            Unoid | blund In ubuntu on ym netbook I can read my FAt sd card from my phone
13:55            Unoid | rules out bad card
13:55       PsychoI3oy@| Fox_1_, http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/index.php/DangerSPL
13:55          kslater | what's the latest radio for the G1?
13:55          blunden | Unoid: you know, tab-completing my name will highlight me which increases the chance that I see it instead of just typing part of it
13:55          blunden | :)
13:56       PsychoI3oy@| kslater, answered on the dangerspl page

13:58            Unoid | or was that maverick
13:58           Fox_1_ | is that big different between 2.22.23.02 and 2.22.19.26I?
13:58         GooseSPL | maverick killed me!
13:58         GooseSPL | Fox_1_: use the newest
13:58         *    MaverickSPL will get you killed
13:58         cyanogen@| so its happening in cameraservice.cpp in handleRawPicture
13:59         GooseSPL | goodness gracious GREAT BALLS OF FIRE
13:59         brinstar | Fox_1_: no theres not much diff
13:59          blunden | Fox_1_: 2.22.23.02 usually gets people bettery reception
13:59            Unoid | anyone use ubuntu or debian and able to get their hone to mount to it?
13:59      MaverickSPL+| Unoid: yeah
13:59         GooseSPL | im on pclos and phone boots fine
14:00           Fox_1_ | is it danger to update radio from 2.22.19.26I to 2.22.23.02?
14:00       PsychoI3oy@| no
14:00        laermiggg | can i use a pre-dangerSPL nandroid backup  after applying the SPL to have my everything back?
14:00          kslater | w00t already updated to the latest radio
14:00           Fox_1_ | I'm asking about danger things be cause
14:00         GooseSPL | Unoid: i had same issue the other day, ended up rebooting and all was fine
14:00           Fox_1_ | I have bricked my phone :)
14:00            Chahk | I gather everyone saw Jon Stewart's rant by now  :)
14:00       PsychoI3oy@| laermiggg, yes, but I think you still have to flash defanged+cm first
14:00            Unoid | well my phone is mounted to my netbook fine now for last minute
14:00           Fox_1_ | and sent to HTC and they replaced motherboard :)
14:00       PsychoI3oy@| I did so and restored my nandroid without booting into the defanged+cm
14:00            Unoid | weird
14:00   NexVision-Desk | pershoot or kmobsHAT here?
14:00            Unoid | my usb cable might be going bad
14:01            m0zes+| Fox_1_: those radios are fine with the "dangerSPL"
14:01           Fox_1_ | so, why I asking 5 times and then do :)
14:01       PsychoI3oy@| don't quote me on that, though, you might be able to do dangerspl->reboot to recovery->restore nandroid
14:01         GooseSPL | Unoid: try rebooting pc
14:01           advil0 | is there a real reason why you can't upgrade to the N1 if you're on a family plan?
14:01            Unoid | goose will do, brb
14:01            Chahk | http://www.news.com.au/technology/jon-stewart-takes-aim-at-apple-appholes/story-e6frfro0-1225860319639
14:01      MaverickSPL+| advil0: you can if you don't care about subsidised phone
14:02       logomancer | Just saw that, Chahk.
14:02           advil0 | yeah i know, but it's a savings of $300
14:02      MaverickSPL+| pay 570 and you can use family plan (and will probably save money over 2 years)
14:02           Nushio | Chahk: was that yesterday?
14:02           advil0 | i don't have 570
14:02         brinstar | advil0: because the android is a porn phone
14:02            Chahk | I think so
14:02           Fox_1_ | m0zes: you mean if I will have 2.22.23.02 radio, it isn't dangerous to install DangerSPL?
14:02      MaverickSPL+| yeah, but the plan will cost you more
14:02         *         Nushio downloads yesterday's TDS
14:02           advil0 | my plan is like $150 a month
14:02          blunden | Fox_1_: shouldn't be, no
14:02        laermiggg | my plan is 1)nand backup  2)flash SPL  2)flash defBase   3)flash Cm4.2.15.1   4) restore nandBU             is that going to work?
14:02            m0zes+| Fox_1_: not dangerous. either  2.22.23.02 or 2.22.19.26I are fine with the "DangerSPL"
14:03           Fox_1_ | ok, thanks
14:03      MaverickSPL+| Fox_1_: it becomes MaverickSPL if you have a 2.x radio
14:03       logomancer | Apple doesn't control the police, and there's a very real possibility that Gizmodo may have broken California law by receiving stolen property.
14:03         GooseSPL | lol
14:03      MaverickSPL+| GooseSPL is dead
14:03         GooseSPL | you prolly bricked it before because you had GoosSPL
14:03         GooseSPL | GooseSPL**
14:03           Fox_1_ | MaverickSPL: what you mean?
14:03       logomancer | Now, Apple visiting the finder's house and asking to search it...that's creepifying.
14:04         GooseSPL | Fox_1_: joking homie
14:04        laermiggg | oh and how much mb are left for apps after SPL?
14:04      MaverickSPL+| Fox_1_: i'm joking cause i hate the monkier DANGERspl
14:04      MaverickSPL+| moniker* ?
14:04           Fox_1_ | who love? :-D
14:04       logomancer | Hey, it was well-deserved. It bricked phones.

14:05         GooseSPL | LOL
14:05            bri3d | copy DangerSPL and renameit to KangSPL
14:05            m0zes+| only dangerous if you have a 1.x radio iirc :) (Because it is a Magic SPL and they have only had >= 2.x radios)
14:05      MaverickSPL+| i wish it had been named MagicSPL
14:05      MaverickSPL+| it's a much nicer name
14:05         -!- GooseSPL is now known as IcemanSPL
14:06      MaverickSPL+| IcemanSPL: DO NOT ENGAGE!
14:06        IcemanSPL | there that is better

14:06      MaverickSPL+| brinstar: that's what lost untangled is for
14:06      MaverickSPL+| whenever you're sad, watch taht shit
14:06         brinstar | i was hurt deep down
14:06       logomancer | Having not really seen Lost, i can't say I'm missing it very much.

14:07        laermiggg | what is JIT and what does it?
14:07       NCommander | laermiggg: Just-In-Time compilation
14:07         brinstar | MaverickSPL: im in the UK, so i end up watching the torrented releases
14:07            Chahk | Does anyone know of a Skype client that properly handles group chat?
14:07         brinstar | never seen lost untangled
14:07        laermiggg | NCommander what does that mean?
14:07      MaverickSPL+| it's hiiiighlarious
14:07      MaverickSPL+| lemme find a link
14:07       NCommander | laermiggg: basically a way to increase speeds * 3x
14:08        laermiggg | does it drain jour battery?
14:08         brinstar | Chahk: the official skype app is in development
14:08         brinstar | Chahk: not sure about group chat tho
14:08           Nushio | NCommander: does CMod 5.0.7 for g1 include it?
14:08       logomancer | laermiggg, JIT  = Just In Time compilation...recompiling apps to native code instead of running an interpreter.
14:08           Nushio | *will it
14:08       NCommander | Nushio: not yet, it won't be fully cooked until froyo
14:08           UX-Guy | JIT is just a more efficient way of running
14:08       logomancer | Much faster, but currently highly unstable
14:08           Nushio | ah
14:08           Nushio | yeah, I had heard its unstable
14:09        laermiggg | oh :( are there chances it will be evry stable so every rom will use it?
14:09           Nushio | I'm currently on OpenEclair 1.3.0, they've been experimenting on it, but haven't enabled it either
14:09            Chahk | Every app I've tried so far didn't support group chat at all.  All the group messages would come in from the sender, instead of in one container.  And there was no way to respond to group.
14:09       logomancer | They're gonna release a stable JIT wih Froyo in a few weeks.
14:09             yath | what's froyo? android 2.2?
14:09       logomancer | Yeah
14:09        laermiggg | can it be portet to G1?
14:09           Nushio | yes yatj
14:09             yath | ic
14:09       logomancer | I imagine the kernel can, if nothing else, laermiggg.
14:09           Nushio | laermiggg: they said 2.0 couldn't be ported to G1  ;)
14:10           Nushio | and look, G1's running 2.1
14:10        laermiggg | it was a big piece of work though
14:10           Nushio | (walking?)
14:10       logomancer | Kinda sorta, lol
14:10        IcemanSPL | who is "they"
14:10           Nushio | Google?
14:10           Fox_1_ | I have tried OpenEclair 1.3.0, it's working very slowly :(
14:10        IcemanSPL | ?
14:10       dugger5688 | froyo is partially an attempt to put all devices on the same API level, etc.
14:10        laermiggg | will all the drivers change from 2.1 to 2.2 or will it be an easy thing to bring 2.2 after 2.1 is finished for the G1?
14:10           Nushio | Fox_1_: I'm on it. I find it acceptable. Though answering phone calls becomes its own mini-game
14:11        IcemanSPL | they also said a computer would never be smaller than a small house
14:11       logomancer | laermiggg, depends on how much they change
14:11        laermiggg | i hope not too much
14:11           Fox_1_ | Nushio: are you using Nexus Launcher as home?
14:11          wergeld | who uses their android phone for phonecalls?
14:11       logomancer | There will be work to be done, doubtless.
14:11           Nushio | Fox_1_: nope

14:13            Chahk | I should be able to sign in to Google on a SIM-less phone via WiFi, right?  Do JF's instructions still work?
14:13  AstainHellbring | laermiggg you cant really remove spl
14:13      MaverickSPL+| brinstar: they have an episode for EVERY lost episode
14:14         brinstar | MaverickSPL: well thats the next couple of weeks sorted :)
14:14        laermiggg | i dont want to remove it
14:14        laermiggg | i want to know how many MB are transfered to /system/
14:14        laermiggg | is that partition incerased by 5 MB or by 20?

14:20        tech9iner | btw bit more Titanium backup trolling gents.. on me tired rom challenged old g1 here.. in concert w fact my professional business needs soak up g1's tiny rom beyond its abilities.. cant be beat me peep'holes.. ;]].. 2kool4skool 2 be able to simply backup say.. droidrecord when not using on conf calls etc.. then
14:21            isieo | yay 10.04!
14:21            isieo | ah crap wrong channel
14:21        tech9iner | fire up Titanium and drop it back in with 60 seconds notice of a conf call.. and record call no worries.. tis the ultimate work round on g1's rom size restrictions
14:22       Boldfilter | cm5 out yet for g1
14:22            kephu | hi
14:22           Flobin | Boldfilter: be patient!
14:22       logomancer | Boldfilter, we'll let you know
14:22       Boldfilter | kk
14:22        tech9iner | and honestly mates.., the Titanium dev updates that app feels like 3x per week too.. most active updates of any android app ive used on me old g1 last 1.5 yrs now.. period
14:23       logomancer | Srsly, the intarwebs will explode when it's out.
14:23           Flobin | true
14:23        tech9iner | ?.. Boldfilter just read the /topic upon ea entry re '5 out yet' no?
14:23            kephu | I just saw THAT VIDEO, and I have a questtion everybody and their mother probably asked a billion times already even mere seconds ago, but humor me here please: will this new upcoming version upgrade from .15.1 without having to nuke everything?
14:23           Flobin | cyanogen is going to have at least 37.5 offers from people saying they'll S his D
14:23        tech9iner | Boldfilter: im just say'n ;]].. hehe
14:24       Boldfilter | Its cool just aking
14:24       logomancer | Boldfilter, they've gotten that same question a lot recently. It's best if you just take the info already given.
14:25           Winkie | so, forgive me if this question has been asked and i have missed things, wasn't the problem with 2.0 that the drivers were binary blobs that couldn't be recompiled to match a newer kernel? that's why video acceleration didn't exist in the existing backports?
14:25           Winkie | is that fixed now, or in the process of it?
14:25       logomancer | kephu, You'll at the very least need to wipe to flash DangerSPL.
14:25      charansingh | i edited the resolution of camera and what i foun was it is not dependent on the apk, idk where the dependicies are
14:25           Winkie | i try and keep up with the news but it's bloody tricky
14:25            kephu | oh, right, I forgot to mention it, damn. I have a magic
14:26      charansingh | so videocamera.java has the options for framerate which is set to 20 and resolution which for high profile is set to 352x 288 but nexus records at 720x480
14:26       logomancer | kephu, Ah. then you shouldn't need a new SPL...they've gotten it to work without a wipe in theory, but is not recommended.
14:26      charansingh | its so confusing
14:26            kephu | meh, figured as much
14:26       logomancer | charansingh, That's because the N1 has better recording hardware
14:26     clarkeismine | logomancer: oh snap... they got it shrunk down enough for the normal engineering SPL?
14:26            kephu | well, I'll probably try this without wiping, thanks to the awesome that is nandroid
14:26        IcemanSPL | when did we get skyfire in the market?
14:27       MichaelJE2 | I have a G1, and other than the fact that i need to wipe to put the DangerSPL on, what other implications does that SPL have? (And why is it called "Danger"?)
14:27       logomancer | clarkeismine, no...kephu has a Magic. Dream users will still need DangerSPL.
14:27           Flobin | hey by  the way, are you guys planning on making/posting a guide on how to get DangerSPL on this website? Or is there already one? I wouldn't mind writing one or something. Maybe on the wiki, I dunno.
14:27      charansingh | logomancer: but isnt it supposed to pick up resolutions given in the apk
14:27          kslater | MichaelJE2: because if you go backwards on the radio, you can brick your phone
14:27       MichaelJE2 | oh! I thought that was on any SPL. Alright
14:28            kephu | Winkie, not sure about the other stuff, but I recall some 2.1 mods getting acceleration to work, not sure how they did that, though
14:28      MaverickSPL+| Flobin: we don't call it dangerspl around here
14:28        laermiggg | why would someone go back on radio?
14:28      MaverickSPL+| we call it happyfuntimeSPL
14:28      MaverickSPL+| TopGunSPL
14:28       logomancer | MichaelJE2, the big thing with DangerSPL is that it frees up more space on the phone for ROMs, thus why they need it for CM5.
14:28           Flobin | haha okay HappyFunTimeSPL then
14:28       MichaelJE2 | EpicSPL
14:28           Winkie | kephu: thanks, it's very hard to properly keep up, especially as i only have a g1
14:28       logomancer | charansingh, I honestly don't know.
14:28          wergeld | I love working around crapy js code! my code skilz are mad!
14:28       MichaelJE2 | Yeah, that's the only thing about it that I knew, logomancer
14:28      MaverickSPL+| Flobin: there is an initial guide that was thrown up last night
14:29           Flobin | oh okay, right
14:29       logomancer | charansingh, If I had to guess, I would say that part of the restriction is hardware-related.
14:29           Flobin | I mean I'm sure there's several guides, like on xda-devs and stuff, I was just wondering if you guys were planning on having one on here
14:29            kephu | Winkie, I only know this because I've been rom-hopping waiting for the proper 2.x rom, and I pretty much found that out by experiencing the deficiencies of existing ones ;) I mean, until they fixed it. But yeah, you raise a valid point, how did they get all the drivers to work?
14:29       logomancer | Flobin, there are instructions on the Wiki
14:30         -!- MaverickSPL is now known as thedude|away
14:30     dippingsauce | logo, its official we will need danger or cyan is still trying to squish
14:30     thedude|away+| dippingsauce: wait and see
14:30             zinx@| o_O
14:30       logomancer | dippingsauce, AFAIK, the official word is that we'll need Danger.
14:30         *   thedude|away hides from the 10000 questions
14:30       logomancer | For Dream users anyway
14:30           Winkie | kephu: i guess we'll find out sooner or later :)
14:30           Flobin | I can't wait!
14:30            kephu | so, I've read tthat 5 is not out yet due to 'size issues' - could someone explain what's that mean, exactly?
14:30       logomancer | BTW, folks, I am not an official CM spokesperson or anything...just going by what I have heard.
14:31             zinx@| there are other issues wrt cm5 not being released yet
14:31           Flobin | haha logomancer, does he have an agent? :p
14:31       MichaelJE2 | I wonder what would happen if he just gunzip'd the system partition at boot time, maybe that could squish it more. :P
14:31       MichaelJE2 | oh, but then it wouldn't fit in memory
14:31       MichaelJE2 | damn
14:31            kephu | also, I wonder about the GPS thing, too. I remember openeclair didn't seem to have gotten it to work
14:32       logomancer | Flobin, how the hell do I know? :P
14:32       PsychoI3oy@| http://twitter.com/cyanogen/statuses/13078190746
14:32       PsychoI3oy@| I just flashed danger a couple hours ago
14:32       PsychoI3oy@| painless
14:32       PsychoI3oy@| (the painful part is all the user questions)
14:32       logomancer | PsychoI3oy, really? hadn't noticed. :P
14:32          wergeld | psycho: but its fun!
14:33        laermiggg | psychoboy after flashing the SPL  how many MB is left for apps?
14:33           sargas | kephu: codeaurora is some open source stuff from qualcomm, he said on twitter or xda he took some stuff from the droid eris leak, camera was reverse engineered a few months ago by NCommander (and he said video encoders was the only problem w/ camcorder, which cyanogen fixed). no need to wait for a release, http://github.com/cyanogen has everything if you understand the code
14:34            kephu | sargas, any word on the gps working, though?
14:34           sargas | kephu: something called opencore was involved i think, no idea what it is though
14:34       logomancer | kephu, AFAIK there are no issues with the GPS
14:34        docsparks | There we go.
14:34        docsparks | I cant beleive how much you guys put up with
14:34            kephu | I'm only asking because other 2.x mods had severe issues with GPS
14:34           sargas | kephu: i thought i had gps working w/ a n1 rom on mt3g
14:35        docsparks | Props to you guys awnsering that shit over and over.  Ive been watching for the past 20 minutes here
14:35       logomancer | I work tech support for a living...I'm used to dealing with retards
14:35        docsparks | Same here
14:35            kephu | sargas, is that an A, or B?
14:35        docsparks | teamviewer is 90% of my day.
14:36     dippingsauce | i could never work tech support
14:36        docsparks | but you guys are awesome.
14:36         *     MichaelJE2 is an embedded development noob, I'm used to using as much memory as possible on big bloated computers. ;P
14:36     dippingsauce | god thatd piss me off
14:36       MichaelJE2 | but yeah, you guys are awesome
14:36       logomancer | And when I say "retards" I mean people who use an AC adapter for a wireless AP to power their laptop.
14:36           sargas | kephu: tmo's mytouch, so B. A needs different drivers, don't know if ports have been made
14:36       logomancer | Where is the Magic-A used, anyway?
14:37       Boldfilter | canda
14:37           sargas | logomancer: england, canada
14:37       logomancer | Of course.
14:37       MichaelJE2 | logomancer: but, it said 12v.... luser face
14:37            kephu | logomancer, Poland
14:37       logomancer | Ah, yes, I forgot Poland.
14:37         cyanogen@| ugh why is this blit failing
14:37       logomancer | MichaelJE2, nono, his excuse was "it fits in the hole"
14:37       MichaelJE2 | bahahaha
14:37            kephu | heh, I see what you did there, logomancer
14:37       logomancer | (that's what she said)
14:38          wergeld | flip the bit and it will be possible!
14:38      charansingh | wooooohhooooooo freaking found the resolutions on nexus
14:38       logomancer | cyanogen, it's just the preview, right?
14:38         *        wergeld goes back to database land...
14:38     thedude|away+| so lucid is out, should i upgrade yet or is it still acting funny
14:39     wtfscrappiie | sighh :\ could anyone help me!
14:39       logomancer | what's up, wtf
14:39          stratos | yo
14:39          stratos | question
14:39          stratos | im not getting mms anymore
14:39          stratos | i get regular sms
14:39          stratos | but not mms, get a download failure message with Handcent
14:39     wtfscrappiie | logomancer, my phone is rebooting to the droid sign :\
14:39          stratos | that a problem with handcent or the phone?
14:39       logomancer | stratos, I'd blame handcent first
14:40        IcemanSPL | stratos: try with regular mms
14:40       logomancer | wtfscrappiie, what phone do you have?
14:40     wtfscrappiie | logomancer, droid
14:40          stratos | IcemanSPL: yeah good idea, im doing that now
14:40        IcemanSPL | logomancer: hopefully a droid
14:40       logomancer | wtfscrappiie, dunno if I'd be helpful then; all I have is a Dream
14:40        IcemanSPL | stratos: basic trouble shooting, if it works like that then it is handcent's issue
14:41            kephu | " all I have is a Dream" <- that's deep man
14:41     wtfscrappiie | koush, u busy :\?
14:41          spaztik | hootie hoooo
14:41       logomancer | I'm a poet, and boy I know it...
14:41          stratos | IcemanSPL
14:41          stratos | not working with built in app
14:41          spaztik | sooo... we have to put DangerSPL on to flash CM5 on D/S?
14:41       logomancer | spaztik, Yes
14:41          stratos | i hit the download button, it does something for a minute or so, and the download button comes up again
14:42         -!- kmobsHAT is now known as kmobs
14:42     dippingsauce | dont know yet spaztik
14:42          spaztik | damn that makes me worry :S
14:42        IcemanSPL | then you have narrowed it down... could be service or phone
14:42          iShawnW | Sucalakafufu: what is a windows library file that if you remove it cant boot and just sits at the loading screen?
14:42     dippingsauce | if it was official the rom would be released cuz last time i checked all cyan was doing is trying to squish
14:42        IcemanSPL | stratos: you sure it isnt downloading?
14:42       logomancer | spaztik, you'll be fine if you have a 2.x radio
14:42          spaztik | iShawnW: lots... ntloader.dll
14:42       MichaelJE2 | iShawnW, uh... why do you want to know that?
14:42          spaztik | logomancer: my fear is that a new radio comes out
14:42       MichaelJE2 | lol
14:42          iShawnW | I hate my C# teacher
14:42     dippingsauce | i can be your new teacher if you want :D
14:42       logomancer | spaztik, What's your current radio version?
14:42     dippingsauce | im nice
14:43       MichaelJE2 | iShawnW, nice
14:43          iShawnW | MichaelJE2: this will be revenge
14:43       MichaelJE2 | ntloader, it's a hidden file in C:\
14:43          spaztik | logomancer: 2.22.19.26I
14:43       MichaelJE2 | remove it and the computer will reboot over and over forever
14:43     wtfscrappiie | anyone good with the cyanogen mod on droid that could asssit me with my reboot problem 1:1?
14:43        IcemanSPL | stratos: have you done anything major to the phone since the last time mms worked?
14:43          iShawnW | MichaelJE2: :)
14:44        IcemanSPL | major = ROM/MODs, apps, backups
14:44       logomancer | spaztik, You're fine.
14:44           kep0ne | anyone here have an incredible yet?
14:44          spaztik | my wife says i have an incredible
14:44       logomancer | OK, question to pose: After flashing DangerSPL, can one flash a new radio?
14:44          spaztik | booya
14:44       Boldfilter | ih man
14:44       Boldfilter | oh
14:44          wergeld | is that on tmobile?
14:44       MichaelJE2 | I'm stuck with a dream until september-ish
14:45          spaztik | logomancer: afaik, you have to go back to an older spl
14:45       logomancer | Incredible is Verizon.
14:45       Boldfilter | I want an incredible
14:45           kep0ne | im thinking of going to check it out today
14:45        tech9iner | mms issues have soooo many levels of potential failure.. carrier.. server burps in between.. blah blah infinitum
14:45       logomancer | Verizon didn't want a Nexus One, so they got an Incredible instead
14:45          wergeld | what the hell is tmo usa getting?
14:45           kep0ne | nexus one
14:45       MichaelJE2 | pretty much the nexus
14:45        tech9iner | anyone fired up tmobiles htc hd2 yet lads?
14:46       logomancer | wergeld, I imagine Dell will be putting out its phones for it later...
14:46       logomancer | ...plus there's the myTouch Slide
14:46        tech9iner | tempted to rant some more with my 4months of 3g  /facepalm fail here and demand they upgrade me antique g1 to the hd2
14:46        waitforit | that dell is like 5" isnt it?
14:46       logomancer | Well, there's the Streak, and then there's the Lightning and Smoke
14:46       logomancer | (or is it Thunder and Smoke? One of the two)
14:47          wergeld | dell? any specs?
14:47       Boldfilter | http://bit.ly/a7tUqQ
14:47        waitforit | i may pick up the hd2 tech9iner, but only when the guys at xda finish getting android on it
14:47       logomancer | Lightning is the standard form factor, but dead sexy. Smoke is candybar phone with integrated keyboard (not a slider)
14:48     wtfscrappiie | does wifi work on cyanogen -_-?
14:48        tech9iner | waitforit: lol.. oh the irony + timing of your nick + me query lol.. hd2?.. w a i t f o r i t     <evilSnickersHERE> ;]]

14:48       NCommander | wtfscrappiie: it should
14:48          stratos | IcemanSPL: its not downloading, and i upgraded from 5.0.5.3 to 5.0.6
14:48          stratos | thats about it
14:48     wtfscrappiie | ncommander, im getting soft rebooots from it
14:48          stratos | im wondering if my APN list or something is screwy
14:48        tech9iner | waitforit: that said.. as in you mean waiting for hd2 rooting and custom modding etc?
14:48       Boldfilter | 99 nice
14:49       NCommander | wtfscrappiie: what hardware?
14:49     wtfscrappiie | ncommander, droid
14:49        waitforit | tech9iner, full android
14:49       logomancer | Ah, the Thunder is Android, the Lightning is WinMo. Details on Dell phones here: http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/22/dells-lightning-thunder-flash-smoke-and-more-a-roundup/
14:49       NCommander | wtfscrappiie: I thought the shloes build of cyanogenmod was a bit experimental
14:49            Assid | PsychoI3oy: are the apns updated?
14:49          Wasabeh | Ah.... new ubuntu.
14:49        IcemanSPL | stratos: that might have been the issue
14:49       PsychoI3oy@| Assid, yes they magically went into your phone
14:50        IcemanSPL | you are beyond my knowledge at this point though
14:50        tech9iner | waitforit: omg.. LOL @ t9.. still unclear?.. ''full' android?.. never heard the ref before.. wtf comes on the hd2 then.. partial android os?
14:50        waitforit | tech9iner, winmo
14:51     robotfactory | Wouldn't Android be "partial winmo os" based on what MS has been saying lately? ;)
14:51        IcemanSPL | suuuuuuusan! whoa i just scared myself, that is scary!
14:51        IcemanSPL | robotfactory: BLASPHEMY!
14:51        waitforit | robotfactory, thats just wrong =(
14:51          Wasabeh | hahaha
14:51     robotfactory | Just sayin...
14:51        tech9iner | waitforit: reeeeally?.. i was looking at tmobiles little ref to it and never once realized any refs to m$ux winmo[NOT!] at all.. lol
14:51         *      IcemanSPL throws a bottle of Holy water at robotfactory

14:52        waitforit | tech9iner, no its windows mobile 6.5. its a nice piece of hardward though, just the wrong OS

14:53       NCommander | Wasabeh: it released?
14:53        IcemanSPL | mr gates owns a chunk of a company that owns a chunk of Red Hat... that is wrong!
14:53       NCommander | tech9iner: ugh, windows mobile on a treo, that's wrong :-/

14:53        tech9iner | jeh_: eh.. no necesssarily in that order presumed here?
14:53       PsychoI3oy@| Assid, http://code.google.com/p/cyanogenmod/wiki/APNlist and http://github.com/cyanogen/android_vendor_cyanogen/blob/eclair/prebuilt/common/etc/apns-conf.xml

14:54         *      tech9iner calls NCommander's 'thats wrong' and raises him with 'winmo is wrong on any hw!' hehe
14:54       NCommander | tech9iner: winmo for awhile was the best mobile OS sadly
14:55       Boldfilter | Oh its just a two year contract lol
14:55            Assid | PsychoI3oy: having the name different shouldnt make a difference  right.. if the carrier name isnt the same as they provide it?
14:55         *      IcemanSPL sees tech9iner's "winmo is wrong on any hw" and raises him with "WIN is wrong on any hw''.
14:55       logomancer | ll
14:55       logomancer | lol
14:55       PsychoI3oy@| Assid, name is meaningless; mcc and mnc are the important things
14:55       PsychoI3oy@| Assid, i think i changed yours because 'mobile office' didn't make any sense
14:56       Boldfilter | Early termination fee applys before you buy it
14:56            Assid | PsychoI3oy: okay.. i just put it as provided by them

14:58        IcemanSPL | got a couple phones at school I am sposed to root, I think I am going to tell them to wait a couple days for CM5
14:59        laermiggg | you can charge them and then donate to cyanogen
14:59     dippingsauce | or buy liquor :O
14:59        laermiggg | ...or buy liquor
15:00     dippingsauce | "I root android phones, proceeds go to cyan!"

15:10        laermiggg | jbeitler who told you there was no 3g in germany?
15:10       NCommander | laermiggg: sounds about right based off my expereince with T-Mobile DE :-/.
15:10         jbeitler | laermiggg: you just did
15:11       NCommander | I dunno if it was myphone or the network, but 3G was very flakey when I was there
15:11        IcemanSPL | you would think that a company's service would be best where they are from lol
15:11         jbeitler | laermiggg: "i naver had no 3G no mather where i went"
15:11       REALfreaky | [04/29/10 02:07:52 PM] <tech9iner> wow.. tmob in germany sux too... NOT encouraging at all.. Dooosh telecom should rule was assumed there.. vs usa side of pond
15:11        laermiggg | yes
15:11       REALfreaky | dooosh telecom?
15:11       REALfreaky | really?
15:11        laermiggg | a double no    means there is 3g everywhere i go
15:11         jbeitler | see double no here means fuck no
15:12        tech9iner | mschoolbus: lol.. quite the history... similarly re my t9 moniker.. typically younger geeks in irc tie it too some rap group called tech9 or ??. and/or the gun.. had me t9 many yrs likewise.. but was silly 'geek wanna be' "tech' ref + lifetime fan of all things SanFrancisco thus non-sports fan grab of SanFran 49'ers pro team ref = 9iner hehe
15:12         jbeitler | but now it makes more since
15:12        laermiggg | well then
15:12        laermiggg | i never came across a situation without 3G
15:12       mschoolbus | tech9iner, well there is a rapper tech9, he is probably awful. and you write kinda thuggish ;P
15:13        tech9iner | REALfreaky: try getting fairly consistent and usable 3g bw for 12+ solid months.. THEN suffer spotty horrid 3g for last 4+ months.. and my 'dooosh' tag is quite generous laddie.. trust me..
15:13       REALfreaky | lol
15:13        IcemanSPL | Tech N9ne = person not group lol
15:14       REALfreaky | i was just wondering if that was their real name
15:14        tech9iner | mschoolbus: thuggish.. lmao.. in decade online.. never heard that ref before one time rofl
15:14        IcemanSPL | and actually he is a very good rapper (if you are into rap)
15:14        laermiggg | jbeiter you got what i mean, now?
15:14       mschoolbus | ninjavideo.net always has crap on him (kick ass website for streaming tv/movies fyi)
15:15       mschoolbus | i just read past it
15:15          stratos | http://www.geekologie.com/2010/04/you_see_what_happens_larry_you.php

15:15       mschoolbus | heh :)
15:16        IcemanSPL | crap on who?
15:16       mschoolbus | tech9iner, when you were first talking, it hurt my head like listening to mind numbing 15 year old chicks talk
15:16       mschoolbus | and i actually thought you were rapping at one point
15:17       mschoolbus | or trying to rhyme
15:17      charansingh | can android encode h264???

15:23       mschoolbus | jeh_ do you have video of this black chick? how'd you go from h264 to that?
15:24       logomancer | jeh_, to encode it in realtime
15:24             jeh_ | logomancer: why would you want to do that?
15:25             jeh_ | for a video recorder?
15:25       logomancer | Yeah, that's what charansingh is going on about
15:25             jeh_ | oh
15:25             jeh_ | i think that might be a bit above his abilities, judging from previous conversation
15:26        IcemanSPL | dun dun dunnnnn
15:26           UX-Guy | jeh_ it would make more sense for something like that to take place in the cloud and come back down to you encoded
15:27        IcemanSPL | CRAP! i was sposed to go buy a frame today!
15:27        matwatson | how can I check if I already have DangerSPL , i cant remember if I do or not its been a while?
15:27        IcemanSPL | what exactly does spl stand for?
15:27             jeh_ | ux: i'm not the one trying to do it ;)
15:27       logomancer | AFAICT, he was trying to get the camcorder to record at a higher resolution.
15:27             jeh_ | its in your nickname!
15:27        IcemanSPL | lol
15:27           UX-Guy | aight.. well whoever is talking about it.. that's who should be doing it that way :)
15:28       logomancer | I mean, if he can get it to work, more power to him. But I think it's a hardware limitation.
15:28        IcemanSPL | nevermind
15:28             jeh_ | second program loader
15:28        IcemanSPL | yeah i got it
15:28        IcemanSPL | googled it
15:28        IcemanSPL | ty
15:28       logomancer | Gods know I want to be able to record videos in something less crappy than 3GP with 8 kHz mono sound...
15:29          blunden | matwatson: boot to the bootloader and it will tell you if it's 1.33.2005 S-OFF or not
15:29        matwatson | blunden: thanks doing so now!!!
15:30          wwyvern | If you have this spl 1.33.2005 but not the S-off bit are you ok?
15:31      charansingh | logomancer:i listened to ur call if 720p doesnt work i will move on 30fps video + 44khz sound
15:31        matwatson | blunden: I get  DREAM PVT 32B ENG S-OFF     |     HBOOT-1.22.2005 (DREA11000)
15:32          rschnck | I'm considering installing cyanogenmod on my N1...for FLAC support, really.
15:33          rschnck | You can revert back to vanilla eclaire, easily, right?
15:33          stratos | rschnck
15:33          stratos | you want a pro tip
15:33          rschnck | That's me.
15:33          stratos | www.subsonic.org
15:33          stratos | do yourself a favor
15:33          stratos | get that goin, and the android app
15:33             jeh_ | rschnck : if you make a backup, yes..
15:33             jeh_ | but you can't un-unlock your phone
15:33     Sucalakafufu | iShawnW: about C# again huh? :P sorry was afk
15:33          stratos | yeah, you cant lock the phone again, once its rooted, its rooted
15:33          stratos | as of today anyways
15:33          stratos | who knows what these fuckers will figure out next. ;)
15:33          rschnck | Eh, not really interested in subsonic.
15:33          Haraken | flashing dangerspl
15:33          rschnck | I only want music on my N1 for flights.
15:33          Haraken | according to cyanoegnmod wiki :)
15:34          rschnck | Well
15:34          rschnck | Is there any other way to only enable FLAC supporT?
15:34          rschnck | I don't care about the rest of the features.
15:34             yath | would someone with an account mind updating http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/index.php/DangerSPL with the md5sums of the images? that's 2112b7df6ed9d0a56897ac23b0399bb5 for spl-signed.zip, 081379e9b525484bcd1ee42bd0031a4c for DRC83_base_defanged.zip and 0c582c27a7615b168cdec66c570395cb for update-cm-4.2.15.1-signed.zip
15:34          rschnck | Isn't there some sort of app that can do FLAC?
15:34          rschnck | (I don't own an N1 quite yet. Getting it in two weeks)
15:36             jeh_ | rschnck: I dunno if there is any app that can play flac.. you might wait til they announce froyo to see if it gets rolled into that.. probably only a week after you get your phone
15:37        matwatson | Thanks would appear that I have DangerSPL
15:38          rschnck | jeh_: Any idea how likely they will include FLAC support?
15:38          Haraken | sweet dangerspl didn't brick my phone
15:38          Haraken | what a relief
15:38          stratos | how does it brick the phone?
15:38          rschnck | Also, I presume the only disadvantage to rooting into my phone is that it voids the warranty, right?
15:38             jeh_ | rschnck : no idea
15:38        IcemanSPL | you mean MaverickSPL
15:38          stratos | rschnck: software warranty people say, not hardware
15:38          Haraken | stratos, if you have the wrong radio it will brick your phone
15:38       mschoolbus | rschnck, i have unrooted my g1 and they gave me warranty :)
15:38          stratos | Haraken: oh damn
15:38          stratos | mschoolbus
15:39          stratos | he has an N1
15:39        IcemanSPL | t-mo dont care they actually dont check their phones with a warranty exchange
15:39       mschoolbus | i realize
15:39          stratos | so if i have a hardware problem, do i call tmobile or htc for the N1?
15:39             jeh_ | rschnck : there's also a small chance that you could brick your phone. but it seems you'd have to do something really dumb to do that.
15:39          Haraken | stratos, htc
15:39          rschnck | jeh_: Ah.
15:39          rschnck | I just found this: http://code.google.com/p/andless/
15:39         -!- IcemanSPL is now known as Codenomics
15:40          rschnck | : D
15:40          Haraken | jeh_, sometimes people follow bad guides they find on the internet... this is becoming less of a problem now that cyanogenmod has a wiki and forum people can rely on
15:40             jeh_ | rschnck : sweet! there you go..
15:40          rschnck | Yup. And it has a directory browsing structure, which is perfect for drag n' drop.
15:40          rschnck | Solved!
15:41          rschnck | Now I just have to buy the phone =/
15:41             jeh_ | Haraken : I think it's become less of a problem because it's pretty mindless to do on an N1.
15:41          Haraken | jeh_, well that too... I was referring to G1
15:41          rschnck | I don't think it'd brick my phone. I'm semi-competent.
15:42          rschnck | But now I have no need to root it :3
15:42          Haraken | forgot everyone is upgrading these days (including me soon)
15:42          rschnck | Unless I want to tether :<
15:42          rschnck | (As I think T-Mobile doesn't allow it?)
15:42          Haraken | I'll be rooting my N1 once I confirm there are no hardware problems
15:42          blunden | matwatson: it should be 1.33.2005
15:42       Codenomics | im not upgrading. too poor
15:42             jeh_ | I don't think you'd brick your n1 either, they've made it pretty simple to do :)
15:42         brinstar | i think im gonna start shitting my own pants soon
15:42          stratos | yeah, rooting the N1 is a piece of cake
15:42          stratos | even i was able to do it ;)
15:43          Haraken | I'm just worried that my next N1 will have a cracked screen too:(
15:43          Haraken | I feel like I'm gonna snap the phone when I am removing the battery cover

15:11         finfin82 | adb install i tried Assid
15:11            ciwrl@| skyfire > fennec
15:11            Assid | skyfire uses server side
15:11     dasunsrule32 | is that news and weather app built into 2.1 or is that a cyanogen special?
15:12         finfin82 | k guess live wallpaper can drain battery very fast
15:12            ciwrl@| dasunsrule32  built into 2.1
15:12         finfin82 | with 50% cpu-usage
15:12     dasunsrule32 | ok, very nice, I like it
15:12            ciwrl@| finfin82 yes
15:12            ciwrl@| these earliy devices werent meant for that
15:12            ciwrl@| lol
15:13         finfin82 | was htop with cm in earlyer versions too?
15:13         finfin82 | thats rly nice ;-)
15:13     Sucalakafufu | ciwrl: haha would reflashing gapps do anything?
15:13            Assid | finfin82: try disabling a2s and then installing
15:13     Sucalakafufu | also im still low on memory for some reason
15:13     Sucalakafufu | everything is installing to /sd-ext but
15:13             zsol | sunjon: thx again, I won't enter another entry in the tracker then. Though I didn't find it.
15:13     Sucalakafufu | my memory is low from after the installation
15:13          mdmadph | did anybody have to download the facebook.apk directly and install it to get facebook sync to work?
15:13            ciwrl@| Sucalakafufu yea, itd overwrite the /system/app/youtube.apk
15:13     Sucalakafufu | mdmadph: mine isnt working
15:13            Assid | when the hell is google gonna realize we need contact groups on our phones as well
15:13            ciwrl@| worth a shot
15:14             zsol | ciwrl: my point is, that link should be visible from www.cyanogenmod.com IMO
15:14     Sucalakafufu | ciwrl: well hopefully. since i already flashed gapps with the initial installation
15:14        BUGabundo | prash Oops! This link appears to be broken.
15:14     Sucalakafufu | :P
15:14          mdmadph | Sucalakafufu: did you do the fix here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=582302
15:14     Sucalakafufu | i didnt do any fix yet hehe
15:14         -!- Zandra is now known as zandroid
15:14         finfin82 | Assid: is it worth?
15:14            ciwrl@| zsolah, well blame SatanR1 :p
15:14            Assid | finfin82: who knows.. im hoping you'd try and report back :P
15:15          mdmadph | Assid: there are some things, like contact groups and facebook task syncing/sharing, that I wonder what google is thinking not building them in already
15:15         finfin82 | i mean fennec ;-)
15:15          mdmadph | Sucalakafufu: :P
15:15          Haraken | dear fedex, please hurry up and deliver my N1
15:15          Haraken | sincerely impatient customer
15:15     Sucalakafufu | haha
15:15     Sucalakafufu | wish mine was ordered
15:15             zsol | ciwrl: :) I'm not blaming anyone, just a friendly suggestion :p
15:15            ciwrl@| lol
15:15         finfin82 | im gonna try
15:16          Haraken | I have at most 3 hours to wait until they are outside their promised time
15:16            DViCE | flashed CM5, i see the android logo and it doesnt go anywhere
15:16            DViCE | should i reflash ?
15:16          mdmadph | Haraken: just got my Incredible from Fedex, so they're working today, at least. :P
15:16            Assid | finfin82: exactly
15:16          Haraken | mdmadph, good to know :)
15:16          mdmadph | Haraken: I'm just being dumb
15:16          Haraken | mdmadph, how is your incrediblE?
15:17            dekar | I think my /data/app and /data/app-private symlinks are wrong
15:17            dekar | where should they point to?
15:17          mdmadph | Haraken: haven't opened it yet, it's at home.  It's one I'm prepping for someone else, but I bet it's badass.
15:17          mdmadph | Haraken: don't have t-mobile service in my area, or else I would've got a nexus one.
15:17            dekar | they point to /system/sd/app atm
15:17           kep0ne | the incredible is really nice
15:17          Haraken | hehe
15:17           kep0ne | i just hate senseui
15:18          Haraken | kep0ne, don't most people really enjoy senseui?
15:18          mdmadph | eh, lots of regular non-tech users love it.
15:18           kep0ne | well, im coming from cyanogenmod
15:18          Haraken | I've never used it myself, but I hear it's supposed to be good
15:18           kep0ne | so, i dont like it much
15:18          Haraken | ahh i see
15:18          mdmadph | makes android look like a million bucks.
15:18          Haraken | I feel sorry for my g1, I want to keep it but at the same time it won't ever get used again if I keep it
15:18            ciwrl@| DViCE no, wait it out
15:18          Haraken | it'll just sit there and get tested with new roms every now and then
15:19            ciwrl@| dekar should point to /sd-ext on CM 5
15:19            dekar | where do your /data/app symlinks point to? could one of you have a look?
15:19            dekar | k thx
15:19            ciwrl@| np
15:20            speef | I've only had one force close with 5.0.7, most days I'd get more than that with 4.2.15.1!
15:20            Assid | mdmadph: wheres the contact groups
15:20          mdmadph | Assid: don't have 'em, that's the thing. :\
15:21          mdmadph | I have no idea why, either, it's weird.
15:21            Assid | we also dont have proper vcard and vcf support
15:21          holmser | damn... 2.1 on the G1 is fast
15:21          holmser | I wasn't expecting that
15:22         finfin82 | gonna donate now ;-)
15:23        PJFonseca | hello. Can i use CM5 with radio 6.35? I have tried the radio 3.22 and hboot-1.33.2010 but i cant make login
15:23            ciwrl@| PJFonseca likely not
15:23         *          Assid wants a battery fix
15:23        PJFonseca | i have a Magic 32A
15:23        BUGabundo | hey PJFonseca you are here :)
15:23            ciwrl@| 3.X radio oshould work, use amon_ra recovery
15:23            dekar | fixing the symlinks didn't fix my problem - somehow I can't install apps a few mb big (getting out of space) eventhough all my partitions have tons of free space and app2sd is on
15:23       Lieutenant | the 'move app' button in the"applicatoins" thing moves it from the sd card to the phone, right?
15:23            ciwrl@| PJFonseca did you flash the ebi1 port file?
15:23        BUGabundo | ciwrl: but PJFonseca has a strange case
15:23        BUGabundo | where old radio will not login or something
15:23            ciwrl@| o.0
15:24        PJFonseca | ciwrl: yes i did
15:24        PJFonseca | everything by the book
15:24            ciwrl@| 3.x radio is wokring for all i know...
15:24        PJFonseca | and still no login
15:24            ciwrl@| PJFonseca you flashed the google addon too?
15:24        PJFonseca | yeap
15:24        BUGabundo | ciwrl: h e always had that prob
15:24        BUGabundo | even on old cm4
15:24        PJFonseca | CM than GApps then port
15:25        BUGabundo | PJFonseca: radio and spl, you flashed?
15:25          sjoeboo | mdmadph: you were adsking about the facebook issues form before? (was AFK)
15:25        PJFonseca | yaps BUGabundo, old cm4 the same thing
15:25          mdmadph | sjoeboo: yep, trying the fix from the XDA forums now -- did you find something out?
15:25      EddieRingle | flashing CM5 now :)
15:25        BUGabundo | PJFonseca: which radio and spl, you flashed?
15:25            dekar | where does android check the available size when installing an app?
15:26            ciwrl@| PJFonseca is it the ebi1 port 2 (there 1st one didnt work)
15:26            ciwrl@| file name should say R2
15:26        PJFonseca | Radio: Radio_HTC_PVT_32A_3.22.20.17.img
15:26          sjoeboo | mdmadph: just getting the older 1.1.0 apk from somewhere (XDA prob), and installing that, but when you do that, you can't upgrade in teh market to the newest.
15:26        PJFonseca | HBOOT: hboot-1.33.2010.img
15:26          mdmadph | sjoeboo: weird.
15:26          mdmadph | let me try and get that, then.
15:26            Assid | wow
15:26            Assid | fennec is slow
15:27         finfin82 | Assid: the app settings screen has an option to move apps from sd to internal memory
15:27            dekar | Assid, are you running it on a g1?
15:27            ciwrl@| PJFonseca your setup is fine, something weird in your case...did you see my question about the ebi1 port?
15:27            ciwrl@| do you have r1 or r2?
15:27         finfin82 | im installing fennec again and move to internal
15:27            dekar | Assid, whenever I try to install it I get out of space - eventough I have space
15:27        PJFonseca | ciwrl: let me check
15:27            Assid | finfin82: technically you are installing.. ten reinstalling. you might as well just install straight to internal
15:27            Assid | dekar: nexus
15:28          sjoeboo | mdmadph: yeah, I get "package file was not signed correctly"
15:28         finfin82 | dunno how...
15:28        PJFonseca | ciwrl: bc-5.0.7-t1-ebi1_R2-signed
15:28          holmser | ok... so why doesn't eclair sync my contacts?
15:28         finfin82 | dont want to restart after changing option
15:28            ciwrl@| PJFonseca idk then, it should be working
15:28          mdmadph | sjoeboo: with which version?
15:28           kep0ne | fuck this rusko song is awesome
15:28        PJFonseca | ciwrl:  i know! Strange thing!
15:28            ciwrl@| pershoot you here? can  you help sort out PJFonseca's siituation
15:28          sjoeboo | mdmadph: I've got 1.1.0 install, trying to update via market to 1.2
15:29          mdmadph | sjoeboo: and the sync works with 1.1.0?
15:29        PJFonseca | always runned away from CM because of this!
15:29     Sucalakafufu | mdmadph: that facebook app may sync. but its worse than 1.2 so im probably not going to use it
15:29         finfin82 | k got it Assid ;-)
15:29        PJFonseca | i think its something related to the radio
15:29            ciwrl@| PJFonseca its not cm's fault
15:29            ciwrl@| lol
15:29         finfin82 | trying on magic ... in a few seconds
15:29          mdmadph | I never use the facebook app, anyway -- just want the sync.
15:29          mdmadph | Sucalakafufu: I use m.facebook.com. :P
15:29            Assid | slow isnt it
15:30        PJFonseca | because radio 6.35 and spl 1.76 works fixe
15:30          sjoeboo | mdmadph: yes, sync works with 1.1.0
15:30        PJFonseca | ciwrl:  i know... :)
15:30          mdmadph | sjoeboo: ooh, what's your link!  I can't get ahold of 1.1.0. :P
15:30     Sucalakafufu | mdmadph: LOL well that has its issues sometimes :P
15:30        PJFonseca | ciwrl: but its a bite strange!
15:30          mdmadph | Sucalakafufu: oh yeah, but it's decent.
15:30            ciwrl@| yea strange indeed
15:31     Sucalakafufu | mdmadph: yah its aight haha
15:31           Fox_1_ | people does 4.2.15.1's themes work on 5.0.7?
15:31          sjoeboo | mdmadph: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=582302
15:31         -!- EugeneKay is now known as EugeneKaway
15:32          sjoeboo | but yeah, i'd rather have the newer version...and sync!
15:32          mdmadph | sjoeboo: in the first post?
15:32        PJFonseca | cyanogen: sorry to bother the KING, but tell me something, can the CM use the 1.76 HBOOT and 6.35 RADIO ?
15:32     dasunsrule32 | I saw passionquickoffice.apk in /system/app, are we going to get an office app now in 5.0.x?
15:32            ciwrl@| dasunsrule32 its there
15:32        BUGabundo | Fox_1_: HELP NO
15:32        PJFonseca | cyanogen: or will it brick the phone?
15:32            ciwrl@| its part of gmaiil
15:32          sjoeboo | I think so, might be a slightly newer one further in
15:32         pershoot | Fox_1_, no they do not
15:32     dasunsrule32 | ciwrl: how's it work?
15:32            ciwrl@| dasunsrule32 gmail uses quickoffice to read docs
15:32     dasunsrule32 | locally?
15:33          holmser | how do I add my google account to eclair?
15:33            ciwrl@| holmser settings > accounts and sync
15:33        PJFonseca | well back to Cursorsense and 1.5 :P
15:33     dasunsrule32 | ciwrl: I have to say, this is the best cyanogenrom to date, fast and stable, even though it is beta
15:34          holmser | all I can add is facebook or corporate
15:34          holmser | no google account
15:34          mdmadph | sjoeboo: it works!
15:34            ciwrl@| holmser did you flash the google addon?
15:34            ciwrl@| dasunsrule32 be sure to thank cyan with some beer $
15:34            ciwrl@| ;)
15:34          mdmadph | sjoeboo: is there no newer version of facebook for droid users?
15:34          holmser | I'll knock that out right now
15:34      canadiancow | did anyone else see the "feedback" feature in the market dev account before google took it back out?
15:35          sjoeboo | mdmadph: not sure
15:35            ciwrl@| canadiancow i thought i was dreaming
15:35            ciwrl@| lol
15:35            ciwrl@| glad im not psycho
15:35     dasunsrule32 | ciwrl: what is the backup settings option do in privacy?
15:35      canadiancow | so google takes all your crash data?
15:35      canadiancow | i had some crash reports from like december
15:35          Haraken | ciwrl, btw your instructions were great for updating dangerspl thanks
15:35      canadiancow | nothign since then though
15:35      EddieRingle | wow, 2.1 is smooth :)
15:36            ciwrl@| dasunsrule32 backsup market apps, wifi settings, bluetooth profiles, livewallpapers to google, so when you wipe, BAM instant restore (well not instant...)
15:36            ciwrl@| Haraken youre welcome
15:36          stratos | yeah
15:36          stratos | the google backup thing was slick
15:36     dasunsrule32 | ciwrl: really? google or cyan mod?
15:36            ciwrl@| google
15:37         finfin82 | feedback? in market?
15:37         finfin82 | that would be great
15:37     dasunsrule32 | great additon!
15:37         finfin82 | i hate getting bad vote without to comment
15:37          mdmadph | ciwrl: is that something built into android, or something CM does?
15:37            ciwrl@| mdmadph android 2.1
15:37            dekar | could any g1 owner with 5.0.7 try to install an app bigger than 10mb? I still get out of space all the time -.-
15:38     dasunsrule32 | ciwrl: upgrade from 1.6 -> 2.1 = perfect after a fix_permissions. THe only thing I really want is the 10mb hack
15:38          mdmadph | ciwrl: cool, cool.
15:38     dasunsrule32 | :-p
15:38          mdmadph | ciwrl: ha!  does it work between phones?
15:38            ciwrl@| dasunsrule32 theres an 8mb hack, but it likely wont work
15:38         finfin82 | Assid: i got low memory with fenne
15:38         finfin82 | +c
15:38     dasunsrule32 | Ok
15:39         finfin82 | cant start it anyway
15:39            ciwrl@| mdmadph between 2.1 android phones, witht he same google account...maybe? i havent tried
15:39     dasunsrule32 | I can wait, it's definitel worth the patience
15:39            ciwrl@| mdmadph i think its by phone though, not google accoutn, could be wrong
15:39          mdmadph | ciwrl: well, i'll give that a try tonight and let the world know
15:39         finfin82 | will 10mb-hack break 3d performance?
15:39          Haraken | anyone try once of these yet or think it's worth the money?  class 10 16gb microsdhc  http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-memory-microSDHC-adapter-included/dp/B0036V9AGU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1272656241&sr=8-1
15:39         finfin82 | for gallery or so?
15:40     dasunsrule32 | actually, I still need to hide the girls wallpapaer, any ideas how to?
15:40            ciwrl@| finfin82 it wont work
15:40            ciwrl@| dasunsrule32 yea, links on cm forums
15:40         finfin82 | so i guess no ramhack for me ;-)
15:40            ciwrl@| but essentially you recompile launcher
15:40            dekar | finfin82, I get it for fennec as well - but also for other apps bigger than 10mb -.-
15:40     dasunsrule32 | I treid the metamorph option and that didn't work
15:41          mdmadph | my camera app is still saying there's no SD card, though, weird.
15:41            ciwrl@| dasunsrule32 ninjamorph can do it
15:41         finfin82 | wennec wath the only thing telling me low memory
15:41     dasunsrule32 | different version of the app?
15:41         finfin82 | *fennec
15:41            ciwrl@| dasunsrule32 new actually
15:41            ciwrl@| stericson released it yesterday
15:41     dasunsrule32 | ok, i will install and try it

15:42         ashfoufa | the only two buggy things i noticed are the preview after taking a picture using the camera, which is a known issue. and after using the gallery, going to a picture, and then going back to the gallery. it gets all messed up with double images and what not
15:43         ashfoufa | apart from that, this rom freaking rocks :O
15:43            ciwrl@| XD
15:43         ashfoufa | the fb sync.. everything :: o

15:46         *        SatanR1 goes back to designing
15:46          sjoeboo | i jsut find it so weird the the 1.2.1 in teh market doesn'tcome w/ the sync ability, but 1.1.0 does, BUT you can't upgrade to 1.2.1 from it
15:46         finfin82 | would google earth run on the experimental rom?
15:46         finfin82 | cant find in market
15:46          SatanR1@| ciwrl good point, ill do that after I've finished tidying up the databse
15:46          SatanR1@| :)
15:46            ciwrl@| sjoeboo cuz market doesnt know that 2.1 magics/g1's exist

15:48            ciwrl@| sjoeboo my magic had no issues...and fb sync is working flawlessly...
15:48            ciwrl@| you want my apk?

15:48      EddieRingle | ciwrl: does cyanogen have debugging output enabled in this rom or something?
15:48            ciwrl@| EddieRingle it should be
15:48            ciwrl@| extra debug stuff
15:48            ciwrl@| like 00000000x0000

16:15         mdmadph | danunsrule32: no luck! rebooting to see if that helps.
16:15         sjoeboo | mdmadph: yes, i've uninstalled/reinstalled, both 1.1.0 and 1.2.1 multiple times.
16:15         mdmadph | sjoeboo: facebook sync?  Thought you had it working?
16:15         sjoeboo | everytimes its: 1.1.0 won't upgrade to 1.2.1, and doing an uninstall/install = 1.2.1 has no sync

16:16         sjoeboo | mdmadph: i do, with the old 1.1.0 version
16:16           ciwrl@| for n1 http://n0rp.chemlab.org/android/nexus/

16:17        finfin82 | i guess i played too much...
16:17           ciwrl@| prolly a mem error
16:17           ciwrl@| low ram or soemthing
16:17        finfin82 | fennec... many many apps + live wallpaper, cam and finaly the gallery killed it
16:18        finfin82 | the logcat was pretty fast... im guessing it was an ram issue..., like you said
16:18         mdmadph | Music plays, so I know my SD card works, but the Camera and the Gallery doesn't recognize the SD card -- damn odd problem.
16:18           ciwrl@| fennec likely killed it

16:18        finfin82 | but i tried severeal times
16:19        finfin82 | guess it still took some ram in background

16:23        finfin82 | as far as i understood
16:23         mdmadph | selectormoldy: uninstall your facebook app, and reinstall the one from the first post here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=582302
16:23          Nauxer | anyone else has a cache folder in the gallery? i think it may be beautiful widgets
16:23    dippingsauce | i dont
16:24   selectormoldy | heh, well, the one from market should work.
16:24      dictionary | I do @Nauxer

16:24         mdmadph | selectormoldy: yeah, but not for facebook sync
16:24         mdmadph | selectormoldy: you need the older one specific to the droid
16:24    dippingsauce | ya my authentication wouldnt work on youtube account
16:24    dippingsauce | that was stupid

16:27         mdmadph | selectormoldy: do you want facebook sync or not? :P
16:27         mdmadph | choose.... wisely.
16:27   selectormoldy | mdmadph: the market version does work, it just started behaving this way after I did a full wipe including my ext
16:27   selectormoldy | wanted a clean slate
16:27         mdmadph | selectormoldy: did it work with facebook sync?
16:27   selectormoldy | yes
16:28         mdmadph | well, it didn't for me, or anyone else in here, oddly enough.
16:28   selectormoldy | the market version worked with sync, I had it installed on my ext with 4.2.15.1, then upgraded to CM5 and it worked.
16:29         sjoeboo | hmm, interesting
16:29   selectormoldy | here's the thing, if you uninstall facebook, then install again from market, then go straight to accounts, add account, facebook, you get the login screen, you login, and it goes right to the tips screen (ie; add widget, live folder), and "finish" button
16:29   selectormoldy | i
16:29   selectormoldy | f you hit
16:29   selectormoldy |  
16:29   selectormoldy | if you hit the back button at that screen, it goes to the screen where you select your sync options
16:30         Haraken | hey if I power my phone on during initial charge will that have any adverse effects on the battery?
16:30   selectormoldy | so yeah something is broken.  heh
16:31         mdmadph | selectormoldy: that's actually a neat tip -- hit back when you get to the tips screen with the normal app?
16:31         mdmadph | did sync work at that point?
16:31   selectormoldy | no
16:31   selectormoldy | but the view for facebook sync options exists
16:31   selectormoldy | after you select your choice, then next, it goes to tips, then finish, it goes to timeline screen

16:31   selectormoldy | if you
16:31   selectormoldy |  dump bac
16:31   selectormoldy | k
16:31   selectormoldy | what the hell is wrong with my keyboard
16:31   selectormoldy | lol
16:32   selectormoldy | sorry, if you dump back to the sync accounts, the facebook sync isn't there
16:32   selectormoldy | brb
16:33         mdmadph | now, google voice isn't working at all, is it.
16:33    dippingsauce | reinstall

16:33   selectormoldy | I'm wondering if the facebook app is seeing that the handset is a Dream, assuming that it doesn't support sync, then skipping right to the Tips screen
16:34    dippingsauce | i got everything working fine except the stupid youtube sign in and now the battery gets eatin like coco puffs

16:35      Lieutenant | so i got facebook on my cyanogen.... how come it isn't integrated with the contacts?
16:35        ciwrl|TV@| ye_olde_droid yesterday
16:35   selectormoldy | what was the trick we had to use to get google nav working on dream at first
16:35        slyboots | For some reason my screen is eating up 70% of the batteryl-life
16:35   selectormoldy | maybe we need to lie about what kind of handset it is to get facebook sync working
16:35    dasunsrule32 | mdmadph: did that work?
16:35         mdmadph | dasunsrule32: doing it right now.
16:35      Lieutenant | oh wth? the facebook thing doesn't work for anyone?
16:36    dasunsrule32 | ok
16:36        ciwrl|TV@| Lieutenant it works for me...
16:36        finfin82 | ciwrl|TV: what will it look like?
16:36   selectormoldy | Lieutenant: it did work at first, but not after a full wipe
16:36        ciwrl|TV@| finfin82 awesomeness
16:36        ciwrl|TV@| ;)
16:36        finfin82 | do i have to unzip it?
16:37   selectormoldy | ciwrl|TV: did you have the facebook app from market installed on your ext before you upgraded to CM5?
16:37        finfin82 | hope it doesnt brik my phone :-D
16:37        ciwrl|TV@| selectormoldy fresh wipe install (wiped ext too), market isntall of fb app
16:37        ciwrl|TV@| finfin82 it wont
16:37      Lieutenant | so how do i just restart the phone, or the pics automatically get synced to contacts?
16:37        ciwrl|TV@| no unzip
16:37   selectormoldy | ciwrl|TV: strange
16:37      Lieutenant | or is there a "sync to contacts" button?
16:37        ciwrl|TV@| finfin82 just put the zip in /data/local
16:38        ciwrl|TV@| Lieutenant auto synced
16:38        finfin82 | k
16:38         DeuX-PT | something weird just happned, i got a call, and couldn't hear anyone, had to reboot the phone and call back
16:38   selectormoldy | ciwrl|TV: facebook sync was working fine for me the first time I installed CM5, leaving my ext the way it was with 4.2.15.1
16:38      Lieutenant | oooooooh
16:38   selectormoldy | (I had it installed previously)
16:38   selectormoldy | but after a full wipe including ext, it broke
16:38   selectormoldy | funky.
16:38      Lieutenant | everyone.... u have to go into "contacts" app... hit "menu" then hit "accounts"  then hit "add account" then hit "facebook"
16:38        ciwrl|TV@| finfin82 looks like http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz2XF67Ag1M&feature=youtube_gdata (sry for the bad music)
16:38        ciwrl|TV@| lol
16:39   selectormoldy | the joys of experimental builds
16:39    dippingsauce | faceblow
16:39        finfin82 | with that sound?
16:39         mdmadph | what other apps are there that we apparently need to reinstall to get to work, like google voice?
16:39   selectormoldy | everything else seems to be working vine, voice, youtube login
16:39          Nauxer | gawd i can't find the nexus' livewallpapers.apk to install them >_<
16:39        finfin82 | :-D
16:39        ciwrl|TV@| finfin82 no, the music is added by the youtube guy
16:39        ciwrl|TV@| ol
16:39        ciwrl|TV@| lol*
16:39    dippingsauce | voice is the only one
16:39    dippingsauce | ive had to reinstall
16:39    dasunsrule32 | that facebook app is the same one that is on the market, isn't it?
16:39        ciwrl|TV@| Nauxer you just install via market
16:40        ciwrl|TV@| and once installed, long press homescreen to select
16:40        ciwrl|TV@|  Fresh CM5 users, d/l this: http://bit.ly/cy71qg put it in /data/local and reboot for prash's bootanimation on your dream/sapphire!!!!!!
16:40   selectormoldy | well, one other issue is market is having timeouts
16:40         *      ciwrl|TV is spamming the sexy ;)
16:40    dippingsauce | oh ya my market
16:40          Nauxer | ciwrl|TV: the originals too?
16:40    dippingsauce | always goes back to the main screen
16:40    dippingsauce | when im in downloads
16:40        finfin82 | works ciwrl|TV ;-)
16:40   selectormoldy | market sits forever when I try to view downloads, then throws this:
16:40   selectormoldy | E/vending ( 4042): java.net.SocketTimeoutException: The operation timed out
16:40        finfin82 | pretty nice
16:40        ciwrl|TV@| Nauxer yes, search nexmod
16:40   selectormoldy | but eventually sorts itself out
16:41    dippingsauce | oh mine just keeps going back to the main market page
16:41        ciwrl|TV@| finfin82 i know it works...isnt it sexy???
16:41        finfin82 | it is!
16:41        finfin82 | ;-)

16:41         DeuX-PT | none, live wallpapers are overrated
16:41        finfin82 | but it uses 50% cpu
16:41         mdmadph | I would prefer one with breasts, obviously
16:42        finfin82 | LOL
16:42        finfin82 | andwobble?

16:42         mdmadph | Cyanogen promised touch sensitive boob-physics wallpapers months ago
16:42         DeuX-PT | anyone had an issue of getting a call and couldn't hear anything? or it was just me?

16:44         DeuX-PT | if u expect to have sexphone with my mom, i must warn you, the phone bill will be expensive
16:44         mdmadph | DeuX-PT: as if I'm going to need it for more than 2 min
16:44         DeuX-PT | damn, you're fast dawg
16:44   selectormoldy | http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-frejcam-bouncingboobs-BxiE.aspx
16:44         DeuX-PT | i pitty the ladies you bumped :(
16:44         mdmadph | DeuX-PT: Sex is a race.

16:45         mdmadph | DeuX-PT: last one to the finish line loses
16:45         DeuX-PT | nah dawg, sex is a marathon
16:45        finfin82 | lol
16:45         DeuX-PT | the longer you last, the bette
16:45         DeuX-PT | r
16:45         mdmadph | marathons are for turtles.
16:45         mdmadph | Turtles are like nature's D-students.
16:45        finfin82 | so guys im going off now.... have fun ;-)
16:45    dippingsauce | you must be playing the wrong game if u think its a marathon!
16:45          Nauxer | in marathons also wins the first to reach the line :P
16:45        finfin82 | gn8
16:46         DeuX-PT | but u have to reach the line with style
16:46         DeuX-PT | not with a rush ;D
16:46    dippingsauce | ya skeet in her hair
16:46   selectormoldy | had to go to a wet t-shirt contest (benefitting breast cancer charities) to keep my mind off waiting for CM5 last night ;)
16:46    dippingsauce | they love that
16:46          Nauxer | marathon runners look pretty funny actually lol
16:46         DeuX-PT | no they don't :|
16:46         mdmadph | yeah, don't bother with live wallpapers on the G1, you were right.
16:46         DeuX-PT | told ya
16:46         mdmadph | Tried a "cylon" one, and my phone rebooted.
16:46         kslater | what's the scoop on CM 5 testing
16:46         mdmadph | DeuX-PT: bows
16:46    dippingsauce | its being tested
16:47   selectormoldy | the sad thing is the last contestant was a big fat hairy dude
16:47    dippingsauce | i think test2 will be a lot better :P
16:47         DeuX-PT | and even if it works, your phone will lag like hell
16:47   selectormoldy | wrong kind of boobs
16:47         kslater | ah, so there have been some issues
16:47         DeuX-PT | selectormoldy wet man boobs? awsome
16:47         mdmadph | up to 2000 men are diagnosed with breast cancer each year.
16:47   selectormoldy | but he did "the worm" in the kiddy pool, pretty fucking hilarious
16:47         kslater | yeah, it's from the estrogen leaching into the ground water
16:47          Nauxer | thank you, another thing to worry about
16:47         mdmadph | kslater: No, it's the estrogen let lose in contrails
16:48         kslater | from all of the misguided women on the pill
16:48         mdmadph | and mixed with flouride
16:48         DeuX-PT | why are we talking about man/man boobs and cancer?
16:48         kslater | no idea
16:49         kslater | I wanted to hear about CM 5 experiences on the G1
16:49          Nushio | whoooooooooo! IronMan 2! =D
16:49         DeuX-PT | the thing i hate the most is the lag on the app tray
16:49         DeuX-PT | all the rest is smoth ~~
16:50         kslater | I run a lot of pig apps - Google Listen, Google Voice, Email, GMail
16:50         kslater | how is it at switching between apps? and coming back to the home screen?
16:51         DeuX-PT | its fast
16:51         DeuX-PT | but i have a 32A not a G1
16:51   selectormoldy | mdmadph: I'm seeing someone reporting that after installing that outdated facebook app to obtain sync, then installing the latest version from market, it keeps the sync and you get the inbox
16:51         -!- BUGabundo is now known as BUGabundo_bones
16:51         -!- BUGabundo_bones is now known as BUGabundo_Bones
16:51   selectormoldy | gonna give that a shot
16:52         DeuX-PT | hum? my facebook syncs ok
16:52         mdmadph | selectormoldy: that would be cool -- tell us how it works.
16:52         DeuX-PT | is not the one from the market tho
16:53         DeuX-PT | i guess i gonna reflash CM4 for the time beeing, too much batery drain for me ~~
16:54         DeuX-PT | in ~2h from 100% to 75% with moderate use
16:54        samruger | anyone know where i can get drivers for windows7 x64 for mt3g?
16:54        samruger | i tried googling but i failed
16:54    Sucalakafufu | ciwrl|TV: haha stop watching tv >(
16:54         DeuX-PT | in the SDK?

16:58        ciwrl|TV@| trl+c to end
16:58        ciwrl|TV@| then right click and hit mark
16:58   selectormoldy | ok, installed old Droid Facebook.apk, sync account added, installing market version over it now
16:58        ciwrl|TV@| higlight text, enter to copy
16:59         mdmadph | ciwrl|TV: gotcha.
16:59         holmser | how come all of my images are really blurry in the gallery?
17:00         holmser | they look really low res, like they should be sharpening up, but they never do
17:00         DeuX-PT | known bug
17:00   selectormoldy | just waiting for java.net.SocketTimeoutExceptions to GFT
17:00         holmser | ahh, ok
17:00   selectormoldy | >:o
17:00    Sucalakafufu | so people who are on cm5-ds. how much internal space do u have free?
17:00         holmser | and does it pull from my picasaweb gallery too?
17:00         DeuX-PT | 220Mb i think
17:00    Sucalakafufu | it seems all of the space taken on mine is in /system ...
17:00         DeuX-PT | im reflashing back to CM 4
17:01    Sucalakafufu | i mean people on cm5-ds on a g1
17:01         DeuX-PT | ah
17:01         DeuX-PT | sorry then
17:01    Sucalakafufu | :P
17:01    Sucalakafufu | np
17:01         holmser | I'm confused as to where all of these extra pics came from.  I don't think they are on facebook
17:01   selectormoldy | huh, package file was not signed correctly
17:01           m0zes+| Sucalakafufu: 20.37MB with dangerspl ;)
17:01   selectormoldy | trying again, maybe a false positive
17:02         holmser | ok, nm.  Just saw the picasa logo.  Thats pretty damn cool.
17:02    Sucalakafufu | m0zes: that's how much free?
17:03           m0zes+| Sucalakafufu: http://pastebin.com/2LfMeb2P df listing
17:03   selectormoldy | ok, it's not letting me install on top of the droid facebook
17:03     BlackBishop | future space could be saved by removing all the tones .. leaving just the defaults for ring and message
17:03         DeuX-PT | they are not that big
17:03         SatanR1@| BlackBishop I think all of the roms should have them removed anyway... waste of space
17:03         SatanR1@| I always use them on /sdcard
17:04     BlackBishop | exactly
17:04         SatanR1@| i have to rm-R media all the time
17:04         SatanR1@| i reflash :)
17:04     BlackBishop | how much space do they use ?
17:04         SatanR1@| not sure .... a few MB
17:04         SatanR1@| 3 - 5 maybe
17:04         SatanR1@| ?
17:05     BlackBishop | whoa .. they should be removed.
17:05     BlackBishop | so should LWP support if it's not full ..
17:05    Sucalakafufu | m0zes: hmm so it seems that its normal to have as little space as i have haha
17:05           m0zes+| Sucalakafufu: probably :)
17:06    Sucalakafufu | hehe
17:06    Sucalakafufu | well i guess that makes the option of installing locally almost useless to us g1 users...
17:06   selectormoldy | market is really behaving badly
17:06    dippingsauce | did cyan know all the ringtones were in this build?
17:06   selectormoldy | I'm sure steve knows about this already
17:07    Sucalakafufu | dippingsauce: yes
17:07         DeuX-PT | yeah allot of ppl complaining about it
17:07         DeuX-PT | tho i didn't had any problem with the market
17:07           m0zes+| Sucalakafufu: pretty much. but it was pretty much useless from day one ;) damn them for giving such a small nand ;)
17:07    Sucalakafufu | ciwrl|TV: man stupid youtube thing is still doing it >(
17:07        ciwrl|TV@| :(
17:08    Sucalakafufu | m0zes: haha yah. well it would be useful if we had more space free like in 4.2. since then i would have certain apps run locally
17:08    Sucalakafufu | ciwrl|TV:  :(
17:08    Sucalakafufu | this is why i need to finish some apps and get an n1
17:09        ciwrl|TV@| haha
17:10        ciwrl|TV@| or one app for $670
17:10        ciwrl|TV@| ... ;)
17:10    Sucalakafufu | hehe
17:10    Sucalakafufu | sure
17:10        ciwrl|TV@| you can make the 'im rich bitch' app for andorid
17:10    Sucalakafufu | i should make the useless app that was in the iPhone app store
17:10        ciwrl|TV@| android*

17:18     OneWayJonny | i thought i woudl follow offical instruction instead of beggin on XDA
17:18    Sucalakafufu | ciwrl|TV: how do taxes work for paid apps on the market? are they taken automagically?
17:19        acoustic | OneWayJonny, zip it
17:19    Sucalakafufu | i read the docs but im still not completely sure
17:19        rlameiro | OneWayJonny: XDA are the official instructions
17:19     OneWayJonny | ok thats fine
17:19        rlameiro | XDA is the first and most important place for ROM development
17:19     OneWayJonny | but a form post from a mod said check here,
17:20            movi | OneWayJonny, go to xda, get the fscking rom, or gtfo and stop pestering people!
17:20        acoustic | we heard ya
17:20        rlameiro | and here people tell how to do it
17:20            yath | boah. this is even fancier than with apple. the pictures are wobbling around in the gallery as i move my G1.
17:20      Lieutenant | hmm
17:20      Lieutenant | wth
17:20     OneWayJonny | movi: shut up
17:20      Lieutenant | who's facebook sync works on the G1 on cyanogenmod 5.0.7 or whatever
17:20    dasunsrule32 | ciwrl|TV: the only thing that needs a bit of cleaning, the battery widget at the top by the clock, the font on the percentage is pretty ugly.
17:20    dasunsrule32 | lol
17:20            movi | Lieutenant, mine does
17:21            yath | woah

17:22   selectormoldy | meh, well I'm getting "Package file was not signed correctly." installation error when trying to overwrite the Droid Facebook.apk with 1.2 from the Market
17:22            movi | selectormoldy, rooted rom from xda?
17:22    Sucalakafufu | selectormoldy: it doesnt work that way
17:22   selectormoldy | yeah
17:22          UX-Guy | Lieutenant I have 3 including gmail, FB, exchange
17:22   selectormoldy | movi: CM 5.0.7 D/S
17:22      Lieutenant | WTH
17:22   selectormoldy | Sucalakafufu: obviously
17:23   selectormoldy | but I am trying to fix sync and get current fb with inbox, and someone reported doing that successfully
17:23            movi | selectormoldy, nuke it from system using adb, then download from market
17:23      Lieutenant | i only have my "gmail" account... when i hit "add account" and hit "facebook"... it juts brings me back to that same screen
17:23   selectormoldy | movi: adb uninstall?
17:23   selectormoldy | or just RM it?
17:24            movi | just rm it
17:24            movi | but one thing
17:24        ciwrl|TV@| dasunsrule32 youre font is really ugly :p
17:24        rlameiro | do i need to install a rom after installing hardSPL????
17:24            movi | you had it IN THE ROM, eg you didn't get it from the market beforehand ?
17:24        ciwrl|TV@| rlameiro yes
17:24   selectormoldy | movi: no
17:24        rlameiro | ciwrl|TV: thanks
17:24    Sucalakafufu | wtf, the inventor of the cell phone said that blur looks like a desireable app and asked why its not on the droid
17:24        ciwrl|TV@| dangerspl wipes /syatem...ie no rom on device
17:24    Sucalakafufu | its NOT an APP
17:24          UX-Guy | Lieutenant did you wipe when you installed?
17:24    Sucalakafufu | and its NOT desireable
17:25   selectormoldy | movi: I installed the droid facebook apk to get sync.
17:25            movi | selectormoldy, from the market?
17:25   selectormoldy | no
17:25        rlameiro | ciwrl|TV: do you advise to make a swap or not?
17:25        ciwrl|TV@| rlameiro i advise compcache, no swap
17:25   selectormoldy | movi: the market Facebook apk sync won't set up
17:25        ciwrl|TV@| my FB market app synced
17:25        ciwrl|TV@| :p
17:25        ciwrl|TV@| you lot just get bad luck
17:25        ciwrl|TV@| lol
17:25            movi | selectormoldy, ok, how are you installing it, and where did you get the apk from ?
17:25          UX-Guy | Lieutenant I had that happen so I uninstalled the FB app (since I had it installed on 4.2) and reinstalled it to make sure that I had a 2.1 compatible version
17:25        rlameiro | ciwrl|TV: compcache??
17:26        ciwrl|TV@| rlameiro enable it in the spare parts menu
17:26   selectormoldy | movi: installed the outdated droid dump facebook apk (1.1.4 I think), which has no issues for sync setup
17:26         *      ciwrl|TV goes back to tv
17:26        rlameiro | ciwrl|TV: so after install then?
17:26        ciwrl|TV@| yes
17:26            movi | selectormoldy, if you're using cm5 now, then kill it, and just get it from the market. it SHOULD work
17:26           A-Pap | Is there an updated Droid dump Facebook apk available?
17:26        rlameiro | ciwrl|TV: thanks for everything man
17:27        ciwrl|TV@| np
17:27           A-Pap | movi - I just downloaded facebook from the market, and it still won't sync.
17:27   selectormoldy | movi: when I install Facebook from the market, I can't get sync to setup.  it skips the sync settings screen after auth in facebook, and never adds the account to accounts and sync
17:27          Nushio | A-Pap: you weren't supposed to use that
17:27          Nushio | the one from market won't sync :P
17:27   selectormoldy | it throws a "User cancelled" issue
17:27   selectormoldy | in logcat
17:27         DeuX-PT | i used facebook 1.1.0 and was working ok
17:27           A-Pap | Nushio - Am I supposed to use the out dated Droid facebook apk?
17:27         DeuX-PT | all sync and shit
17:28          Nushio | yes, A-Pap
17:28         spaztik | Radio, THEN DangerSPL right?
17:28          Nushio | if you're interested in sync
17:28          Nushio | the latest one that works is 1.1.2
17:28         SatanR1@| cyanogen PM me when you are about please.
17:28          Nushio | taken from OpenEclair 1.3.0
17:28           A-Pap | Nushio - Cheers.
17:28            Rede | Is it possible to install additional LWPs in 5.0.7?
17:28   selectormoldy | rede: search market for live wallpapers.  yes.
17:28         DeuX-PT | yes
17:28            Rede | oh lol, that makes sense
17:29           Gordi | does anyone know if it is possible to use helixlauncher or launcher2 on 5.0.7D/S?
17:29         DeuX-PT | but imo, lwp are overrated, and will kill your batery in no time
17:29         spaztik | --- Radio, THEN DangerSPL right?
17:29            Rede | always looking for a difficult way :P
17:29            Rede | I am using Helix Launcher
17:29          UX-Guy | nushio I'm  successfully running 1.2 from the market
17:29            Rede | couldnt find a working launcher2.apk tho
17:29            Rede | Helix Launcher 2 had giant icons
17:29          Nushio | UX-Guy: with sync?
17:29            Rede | but Helix Launcher (orig) worked
17:29      Lieutenant | UX-Guy, yeah i wiped. then i installed the new one from the market

00:09          Valerin | zactastic lol
00:09              d_p | but what about the part of the cm update script that backs up the proprietary files?  If its a complete wipe, theres nothing to backup
00:09           Juggie | twois10, i'm looking @ the process list, theres nothing running besides what belongs to android specifically or google apps.
00:09        zactastic | shit works
00:09          Valerin | d_p then it backs up nothing
00:09         mytharak+| iShawnW assumes it was a mouth
00:10        zactastic | valerin: just dont put it at both spots so they dont know thats what you are trying to do
00:10          iShawnW | lol
00:11     thatcalifire | haha I was just asking that to myself
00:11          iShawnW | alright gonna fill the car up with gas and get some redbull
00:11           Juggie | twois10, http://pastebin.com/d67XjPxh
00:11     thatcalifire | if its backing up files what the hell is it backing up if I did a complete wipe
00:12          Valerin | iShawnW, redbull is the only way to kill the vodka flavor.... better get a few
00:12          Valerin | thatcalifire, are you coming from CM or another rom?
00:12     thatcalifire | advid CM user
00:13          Valerin | g1 or n`1
00:13        zactastic | run the vodka through a PUR pitcher, makes it smoother
00:13     thatcalifire | mt3g
00:13          Valerin | zactastic, i call bs on that one
00:13        zactastic | valerin: try it
00:14          twois10 | Juggie:  this is what mine looks like: http://pastebin.org/197633
00:14          Valerin | thatcalifire, its backing up what is already there for gapps.
00:14        zactastic | valerin: not with the good stuff
00:14        zactastic | valerin: the rotgut type shit
00:14     zombiereagan | heh, powertop is actually pretty cool
00:14          Valerin | zactastic, i think mythbusters or someone did a test on that... busted it
00:14           djmesh | sall about popov or fleishmans :(
00:15        zactastic | valerin: hmm... i dont know, my experiments show that it takes the edge off
00:16        piusvelte | is there a fix to gmail force quitting on cm5.07 on g1?
00:16     thatcalifire | damn long time to boot for the first time huh?
00:16          Valerin | zactastic, i avoid the whole issue and dont drink vodka
00:16     zombiereagan | is there a reason why HPET isnt configured?
00:16          Valerin | they say you cant taste vodka, but thats bullshit too
00:16         *        Valerin is currently drinking bacardi gold
00:16     zombiereagan | Suggestion: Enable the CONFIG_HPET_TIMER kernel configuration option.
00:17        zactastic | not the "good stuff" they say but i wouldn't know cant afford it
00:17     zombiereagan | Without HPET support the kernel needs to wake up every 20 milliseconds for
00:17     zombiereagan | some housekeeping tasks.
00:17     zombiereagan | Wakeups-from-idle per second : 95.3     interval: 10.0s
00:17          Valerin | i am one of the few that can actually taste vodka... and to me, it tastes horrible, so i dont drink it
00:18           Juggie | twois10, looks close enough to me.
00:18     zombiereagan | Valerin: get better vodka
00:18          Valerin | grey goose not good enough?
00:18         mytharak+| I taste vodka. each different variety tastes slightly different
00:18          Valerin | absolute is mid grade stuff
00:18          Valerin | smirnoff is crap
00:18     zombiereagan | i dont care much for absolute
00:18         mytharak+| my favorite is 44 north idaho huckleberry vodka
00:19     zombiereagan | i like Stoli
00:19         mytharak+| good stuff
00:19          Valerin | skyy is between crap and midgrade
00:19       mschoolbus | Grey goose is delish
00:19         mytharak+| skyy is ok
00:19          Valerin | ive tried it all.... i just dont like the taste
00:19         mytharak+| tha goose is ok
00:19     zombiereagan | yeah, everyones got their thing
00:19          Valerin | so i drink other things
00:19     zombiereagan | i cant stand gin
00:19         mytharak+| sure beats cheapo low end monarch vodka
00:19     zombiereagan | it tastes like what PinSol smells like :P
00:19          Valerin | rum, cognac, whiskey
00:20          Valerin | zombiereagan, rofl
00:20          twois10 | Juggie:  there are only a few processes that differ
00:20        zactastic | only thinkg i really pay for is crown... i love me some crown
00:20          Valerin | crown is ok.... make washington apples out of it

00:20       mschoolbus | Yum
00:21          Valerin | yeah... i got GIGGLY drunk on a gallon of them one night
00:21          Valerin | crown royal, apple pucker, and cranberry juice (NOT cocktail)
00:21          Valerin | tastes like apple.... you CANT taste the alcohol at all if they are made right
00:22     thatcalifire | lol how do you emulate ^X on the mt3g//
00:22        zactastic | almost like a royal fuck crown paech schnapps cranberry

00:25          Valerin | yeah... a lot of people have tried the filtering of crappy vodka to make it taste better.... i say the only way to make it taste better is dont drink it
00:26          Valerin | i buy a bottle... why should i have to work with it before i can drink it?
00:26        zactastic | lol its cheaper?
00:26          Valerin | if im gonna do all that... why dont i just brew my own alcohol?
00:26        zactastic | lol its cheaper?
00:27     thatcalifire | anyone know how to exit and save in the nano client on mt3g?

00:51       Lieutenant | G1
00:51          Valerin | iShawnW, before you go to bed... make sure you drink a big glass of water within the hour before you crash out.... a hangover is simple dehydration
00:51 Join to #Cyanogenmod was synced in 11 secs
00:51          iShawnW | Valerin: I know
00:52          iShawnW | in a few minutes I am gonna eat a few slices of bread too
00:52          Valerin | Lieutenant, sounds like your battery is getting ready to crap out
00:52       NCommander | Lieutenant: running anything that might cause it to discharge unusually fast?
00:52         *     NCommander can get his battery to discharge while charging
00:52        zactastic | i keep the bottlecap from ever beer and drink a small cup of water for every one
00:52       Lieutenant | lmao wtf NCommander
00:52          Valerin | the whole key to preventing a hangover is hydration
00:53       Lieutenant | oh
00:53       Lieutenant | it says "Maps" is using 89% of my battery
00:53       Lieutenant | wtf
00:53          iShawnW | Valerin: my bartender said ice, 2/5 vodka 3/5 redbull. should I ditch the ice?
00:53       Lieutenant | it's not even open
00:53          Valerin | drink a big glass (20 oz or more) within one hour of going to bed....
00:53          Valerin | iShawnW, NO
00:53          iShawnW | Valerin: ok
00:53          twois10 | I  think people mis read the battery usage status
00:54       Lieutenant | apparently i do.
00:54          Valerin | if you want insurance, take 2 tylenol or aspirin when you go to bed with your water
00:54          iShawnW | Valerin: thats why I like you, you keep me from feeling like shit the next day hopefully (no homo)
00:54       Lieutenant | well maps isn't open. says advanced task manager...
00:54          twois10 | If it says maps is using 89% of your battery, it simply means you are not using any other program
00:54       Lieutenant | and no apps are runing except for "swype"
00:54          twois10 | it does not mean that maps is draining your battery
00:54       Lieutenant | oh i see.
00:54          Valerin | Lieutenant, reset your battery stats?
00:54          Zaerath | Has anyone tried Google Earth in CM 5.0 on a Dream yet? Kinda curious how shitty it runs.
00:55       Lieutenant | well. then any reason why it's taking soo long to  charge?
00:55       Lieutenant | Valerin, how would i go about doing that?
00:55          iShawnW | Lieutenant: wifi on?
00:55          iShawnW | bt?
00:55       Lieutenant | yaah wifi is on (only)
00:55       Lieutenant | but i have it on every day
00:55       Lieutenant | and it never takes this long
00:55       Lieutenant | takes like an hour at most
00:56        zactastic | lieutenant: battery stats can be reset in recovery
00:56       Lieutenant | ooh gotcha.
00:56       Lieutenant | i'll reset it once it goes to 100%
00:57        zactastic | lieutenant: i think its under the wipe section? i'm not sure
00:57          iShawnW | mytharak: what is the android guy in you bottom dock thing?
00:57          twois10 |  here is another way to understand the meaning of the battery usage stats. Say you have a million dollars on you bank account. You spent 90$ on porn, 4$ on condoms, and $6 on lotion, your back statement will read 90% of your expense is spent on porn, it does not mean you are poor
00:58        zactastic | just happy
00:58       Lieutenant | one thing i dont quite understand is... well.. i had Hero_Over's Hero rom ever since he released it up until yesterday. and i was using the regular android home instead of Sense-home. and it loaded INSTANTLY every time. even after heavy web browsing and picture viewing. how come this is a non-hero rom, but the home screen takes a while to load sometimes?
00:59       Lieutenant | i mean did the guy do some special optimizing?
00:59       Lieutenant | or was it because of the swap? or something?
00:59       Lieutenant | lmao @ your sexual analogy twois10
00:59          Valerin | sorry... stepped away to make another drink
00:59        zactastic | brb
01:00          twois10 | Lieutenant: no, it was a battery analogy
01:00          iShawnW | Valerin: my bartender says I can only do three drinks
01:00          twois10 | lol
01:00          Valerin | resetting battery stats, is an option in amon_ra's recovery
01:00       Lieutenant | lol
01:00       Lieutenant | damn u
01:00          Valerin | iShawnW, 3 drinks ever or ???
01:00       Lieutenant | yah, im gonna do that once i hit 100% battery charge
01:01       Lieutenant | oops.
01:01       Lieutenant | i just froze my phone
01:01         -!- MeshAway is now known as djmesh
01:01         *         djmesh is back.
01:01       Lieutenant | i opened "gallery" and kept my phone idle until the screen turned off
01:01       Lieutenant | now it wont turn back on
01:01           Chopes | reboot
01:02       Lieutenant | reboots
01:02          iShawnW | Valerin: 3 drinks before she thinks I will be done
01:02          iShawnW | for the night
01:02          iShawnW | Valerin: brb snack time
01:02          Valerin | lol
01:03             didy | HTC desire or Nexus One!!!!!!!!!!
01:03       Lieutenant | nexus one
01:03       Lieutenant | with desire rom
01:03       invaderkay | Is the source for this rom anywhere? <--- is a noob.
01:03       Lieutenant | n1 has dual mics
01:04          Valerin | nexus one... sense ui is a resource HOG
01:04        karnage42 | Valerin: is there any trick when using the battery stat reset? should you let the battery drain first? does it matter?
01:04             didy | dual mics???
01:04       Lieutenant | a mic where you speak, and a mic on the back, so it can cancel out background noise
01:04          Valerin | karnage42, when you reset the stats, use the phone like you normally would.... just let it run completely down before plugging into a charger
01:04          twois10 | invaderkay: http://github.com/cyanogen
01:05        karnage42 | Valerin: thanks
01:05          Valerin | karnage42, you're welcome
01:05       invaderkay | Thanks twois.
01:06             didy | lol
01:06          Valerin | sheesh.... its almost time for another drink.....
01:06             didy | well..
01:06          Valerin | id say i was an alcoholic... but they go to meetings LOL
01:07          Valerin | brb... alcohol filtering in process........
01:07            K0HAX | AA is for quitters!
01:07             didy | are u all nerds???
01:08             didy | my friends say people on android are nerds.. iphone are trendy people! i so disagree...
01:09         mytharak+| iShawnW, that's my android menu
01:09       Lieutenant | lol
01:09       Lieutenant | @ didy
01:09         mytharak+| contains ADB stuff, eclipse, etc
01:09     netcrusher88 | anyone have and fix the issue where facebook won't sync?
01:09          iShawnW | mytharak: ah
01:09          iShawnW | who wants to watch me get drunk!?
01:09          iShawnW | starting the tiny chat in moments
01:09     netcrusher88 | er. where you can't set up a facebook account for sync
01:10         mytharak+| iShawnW, you're not already drunk?
01:10       Lieutenant | netcrusher yah
01:10       Lieutenant | u have to get facebook 1.1
01:10     netcrusher88 | how do i go about that
01:10       Lieutenant | http://www.sizzledcore.com/2009/11/17/facebook-1-1-for-android/
01:11          iShawnW | mytharak: no sister just left
01:12     netcrusher88 | so it turns out
01:12     netcrusher88 | i have the one from market, which is 1.2
01:12     netcrusher88 | and it gives me the option to add a facebook account, it just doesn't work
01:12       Lieutenant | fail.
01:12       Lieutenant | since my phone restarted... my battery is listed as "full"
01:13     netcrusher88 | which may be different from the problem you had
01:13       Lieutenant | it didn't get the otehr 24% charged :(
01:13     netcrusher88 | but it's a problem other people are having
01:13       Lieutenant | netcrusher, i know
01:13       Lieutenant | get the facebook i listed
01:13       Lieutenant | i had the same problem
01:13       Lieutenant | but anyways... this facebook sync is gay as shit
01:13       Lieutenant | sense facebook sync is what i  thought it would be like
01:13       invaderkay | Haha
01:14       Lieutenant | all it did was import all my facebook contacts into my phonebook
01:14     netcrusher88 | worst. regression. ever.
01:14       Lieutenant | i dont want that!
01:14     netcrusher88 | "v 1.2 changelog: broke sync"
01:14       Lieutenant | i just want to have pics for the numbers i ALREADY have on my phone.
01:14     netcrusher88 | well
01:14     netcrusher88 | one thing you can do
01:14     netcrusher88 | join facebook contacts with the ones you already have
01:15       REALfreaky | Lieutenant: im pretty sure u can change that as a setting
01:15     netcrusher88 | then tell Contacts not to show facebook
01:15     netcrusher88 | might work
01:15       Lieutenant | another thing that sucks is... that it only gave pictures to like 20 of my contacts
01:16     netcrusher88 | takes a few tries to get a full sync maybe
01:16     netcrusher88 | facebook app is kind of garbage
01:16           Milias | alright updated the bug site with a statement saying i saw what appears to be excessive drain on a 32B as well as 32A, not nearly as bad though
01:16     netcrusher88 | like, on donut all i ever used it for was facebook phonebook live folder
01:17       Lieutenant | im gonna get me a N1 or something and use the desire rom
01:17     netcrusher88 | because the touch site is better in pretty much every way
01:17       Lieutenant | that's the facebook sync im used to
01:19       Lieutenant | k i just wiped battery stats
01:19       Lieutenant | what wll happen if fi wipe rotate settings?
01:19       Lieutenant | if i *
01:19     netcrusher88 | nothing, most likely
01:20       Lieutenant | oh
01:20     netcrusher88 | there was a bug for a while that would make rotate get stuck, i think that's what that tool is for
01:20           Chopes | oh shit
01:20       Lieutenant | oh i see.
01:20           Chopes | carbobm went off in NYC
01:20           Chopes | check local news
01:20           Chopes | asap

01:20         *     Lieutenant checks yahoo.com
01:20           Chopes | they saying they don't know who did it

21:05          DeuX-PT | its pr0n time
21:06          twois10 | I think some people who think their battery is draining are hypochondriac. Its all mental. You battery is not really draining.
21:06          twois10 | lol
21:06     CountDeMonet | hey would the same gapps file for the dream 32b work for the magic? I assume so but I just want a confirmation
21:07              itp | i'm looking at what my phone has been up to since i left for dinner a few hours ago, and the updated boot.img / libhtc_ril.so that cyanogen posted a few hours ago seems to have done a lot for me, at least
21:07              itp | in terms of battery life
21:07          DeuX-PT | CountDeMonet yes
21:08     CountDeMonet | thanks DeuX-PT
21:08              itp | i think those apps are just straight from the latest nexus one firmware
21:08         *        DeuX-PT is building up courage to go watch Avatar
21:08              itp | hence ERE36B
21:08           Juggie | have not seen it yet?
21:09          DeuX-PT | started
21:09          DeuX-PT | but falled asleep
21:09          DeuX-PT | after 10 min
21:09           Juggie | haH
21:09     zombiereagan | courage?
21:09           Juggie | its a good movie
21:09     CountDeMonet | thats what i figured, but you know, im helping my cousin install the 5.07 and i have a g1
21:09           Juggie | any updates on g1 battery drain? any thing thats avail to test?
21:09     zombiereagan | afraid you might turn furry if you watch a movie with blue alien catpeople?
21:09          DeuX-PT | zombiereagan yeah cause it's 2AM here and the movie is a 3h movie :>
21:09     zombiereagan | OH
21:09          twois10 | Juggie: i thought you fixed it
21:10              itp | Juggie: 16:44 <@cyanogen> theres a new boot.img and libhtc_ril.so at http://n0rp.chemlab.org/android/testing
21:10          DeuX-PT | watched Legion also, nice movie, sucky ending
21:10          twois10 | Legion was a horrible movie
21:10          twois10 | waste of time
21:10     zombiereagan | that one looked shaky from the previews
21:11          DeuX-PT | nah it was cool till like 60% of the movie
21:11      PhoenixWing | Hello, after installing the Cyanogen Rom onto an HTC Magic, will Cyanogen allow me to activate my phone with Google over Wifi or bypass the registration screen completely? I have no data plan and dont want to be stuck
21:11          DeuX-PT | then they rushed everything and facked it up
21:11     zombiereagan | the second they used the "SEE THE SWEET OLD LADY? OMG DEMON!!" card, it was over
21:11     zombiereagan | i knew i wasnt gonna bother with it
21:11          DeuX-PT | meh, was ok
21:12          twois10 | back script and horrible story
21:12          twois10 | plain and simple
21:12          twois10 | The movie SUCKED
21:12          DeuX-PT | last week i was very high so i got the oldies sindrome
21:12     zombiereagan | Avatar was good in the theater, in 3D
21:12          DeuX-PT | and watched all back to the future movies
21:12     zombiereagan | i dont think it would be as good at home
21:12          DeuX-PT | + police academy
21:12          DeuX-PT | ahah
21:13          twois10 | Avatar is another moive the is a combo of Pocahontas, Matrix, Dances with the wolves I swear
21:13          DeuX-PT | don't spoil it bicis
21:13          DeuX-PT | didn't saw it yet :D
21:14          DeuX-PT | anyway zombiereagan this country sucks so much that we just have 1 or 2 cinemas prepared for 3D
21:14          DeuX-PT | and the nearest cinema near my place is at 100km
21:14     zombiereagan | Airplane 2 was on last saturday, pretty early, and my wife couldnt figure out why i thought it was funny
21:14     zombiereagan | :\
21:14          DeuX-PT | so i just ended up buying a projector and i download the movies
21:15          DeuX-PT | with 7.1 audio
21:15     zombiereagan | i was a little dissapiiionted
21:15          DeuX-PT | ahah
21:15     zombiereagan | DeuX-PT: ouch, yeah, if its not an option..not much you can do
21:15        natediddy | airplane :D
21:15          twois10 | i have a site where you can watch all good quality movies
21:15             zinx | DeuX-PT: <spoiler>there are blue guys !!</spoiler>
21:15          twois10 | am sure you already know it
21:15        natediddy | one of the best comedies imo lol
21:15          DeuX-PT | die zinx!
21:16          DeuX-PT | best comedy later is what happened in vegas imp
21:16          DeuX-PT | imno*
21:16          DeuX-PT | damn
21:16          DeuX-PT | imo*
21:16     zombiereagan | the Samsung 3D tv's seem like a good idea, until you see that the stupid LCD glasses cost $200 each
21:16          DeuX-PT | better buy a projector
21:16          DeuX-PT | it's cheaper and it gives u that "cinema" feeling
21:17             zinx | zombiereagan: and realize they give you a headache, and that there's only one film even worth watching in 3D because it is the only one that was made for it
21:17     zombiereagan | zinx: there is that
21:17     zombiereagan | the glasses in the theater didnt give me a headache
21:17             zinx | different tech
21:17          DeuX-PT | and besides, with a projector u can watch HD porn all over your wall
21:17     zombiereagan | but those lcd shutters might
21:18          AmyWolf | i just know i'm gonna brick my phone XD
21:18           tophyr | theater 3d sucked cuz your eyes would try to focus on objects that are rendered out of focus
21:18          DeuX-PT | AmyWolf send it to Africa after, to be part of a brick wall in some school
21:18             zinx | tophyr: a limitation of all current tech
21:18          AmyWolf | i'm doing my best to follow the steps though so <.<
21:18     zombiereagan | zinx: the funny part is, those LCD shutters arent anything new....they tried to do sega games with those back in the late 80s
21:19          AmyWolf | and double checking everything to make sure i have the right stuff, etc <.<
21:19        thewizord | http://xkcd.com/
21:19        thewizord | lol @ current page
21:19           tophyr | zinx yeah i spent an idle half hour trying to think of a way to beat that and wasn't smart enuf, sadly
21:19          DeuX-PT | just me thinking that 3D is overrated?
21:19            bri3d | LCD shutter glasses were immensely popular for visualization of datasets in the 90s
21:19             zinx | zombiereagan: yeah.. the difference, though, is that the refrash rate is a lot faster now
21:19            bri3d | every SGI system ever supports them
21:19     zombiereagan | DeuX-PT: it's a gimmick
21:19           Juggie | twois10, i didnt fix it, i disabeled every possible thing i could and it did not sleep, it does sleep w/o an SD card though
21:20          AmyWolf | well
21:20          AmyWolf | my phone still boots
21:20          DeuX-PT | ty for the new word i learned today zombiereagan
21:20          AmyWolf | \o/
21:20          DeuX-PT | aha
21:20     zombiereagan | zinx: yeah, and it might end up being decent in a few years, who knows....it's just seems like a tough sell to get people in as an early adopter on those
21:20       mschoolbus | hi everyone
21:20          DeuX-PT | i actually had to google it, to know the meaning
21:20       mschoolbus | gratz AmyWolf \o/
21:21          AmyWolf | though all I did was upgrade the radio so i can put dangerspl on
21:21          DeuX-PT | it's a start :D
21:21           Juggie | twois10, i guess the next step would be to uninstall apps until i have enough of them deleted that i can move the remainder onto the phone memory, then pull the SD and see what happens.
21:21          AmyWolf | yeah :D
21:21       mschoolbus | hopefully this battery drain issue is solved soon :S
21:21     zombiereagan | DeuX-PT: sorry about that..
21:21          DeuX-PT | zombiereagan it's cool man
21:21          DeuX-PT | i like to learn new words
21:21          DeuX-PT | :D
21:22           Juggie | i flashed cm5 before sleep and left the phone idle on a full charge, after 8hrs it was @ 5% battery and had only slept 30 seconds the whole night.
21:22           G^ViCE | http://imagestore.ugbox.net/image/JagerSmall_93fd822534729ae0b4685.jpg
21:22          AmyWolf | too bad my phone is going to get replaced soon and i'll have to do this ALL over again :d
21:22          AmyWolf | :D*
21:22             zinx | Juggie: Known issue.
21:22           Juggie | zinx, ya i know, but heres the kicker
21:22          DeuX-PT | G^ViCE where's the fun on that pic? :|
21:22           Juggie | if i pull the sd card
21:22           Juggie | it doesnt happen
21:22           Juggie | it sleeps happily.
21:22             zinx | Juggie: it's random.
21:23           G^ViCE | jager was fun!
21:23          DeuX-PT | who's jager? :|
21:23           G^ViCE | my dog that died last week
21:23       mschoolbus | jagermeister
21:23          DeuX-PT | oh
21:23           G^ViCE | jagerbomb!
21:23           Juggie | zinx, not really random for me, it doesnt work at all but with the sd pulled, it works.
21:23          DeuX-PT | sorry man
21:23           G^ViCE | <3
21:24          DeuX-PT | my dog died like 4 months ago
21:24          DeuX-PT | actually he was shooted down
21:24          DeuX-PT | cause he was sick
21:24           G^ViCE | ur kiddin
21:24           G^ViCE | oh
21:24           G^ViCE | damn
21:24          DeuX-PT | yeah
21:24           G^ViCE | what sorta dawg?
21:24             zinx | Juggie: shrug
21:24          DeuX-PT | a poddle
21:24           G^ViCE | we own such manly dogs don't we
21:24          Loonacy | My dog died, too. :(  He choked on the neighbor's femur.
21:24          Loonacy | Poor dog.
21:25           G^ViCE | femur... isnt that a bone?
21:25          DeuX-PT | some stupid bug bitted his thung, and it's started to rot
21:25          Loonacy | Maybe.  >.>
21:25     zombiereagan | maybe?
21:25       mschoolbus | your dead dogs are haunting my cm5 and eating battery
21:25          DeuX-PT | so he couldn't eat and started to smell bad from his mouth
21:25            ApEtc | G^ViCE: I think you are starting to get the joke... :)
21:25          Loonacy | They were able to reattach the leg, so just drop it already!
21:25          DeuX-PT | so the vet told us he had to take him down
21:25         *         G^ViCE slaps ApEtc around a bit with a large trout
21:25         *         G^ViCE slaps Loonacy around a bit with a large trout
21:26          AmyWolf | bah
21:26          AmyWolf | can't flash spl-signed (bad) :<
21:26           G^ViCE | thung  = tongue?
21:26         *        DeuX-PT prepares ApEtc to be shown on rotten.com
21:26         *        Loonacy slaps a large trout around a bit with G^ViCE
21:26          DeuX-PT | yeah tongue
21:26           G^ViCE | ah right
21:26          DeuX-PT | sorry, im Portuguese
21:26          DeuX-PT | sometimes my english skills fails
21:26          DeuX-PT | :D
21:26       mschoolbus | AmyWolf, what happened?
21:26          twois10 | juggie, we know that it is a compatility issue of some sort but we dont know which app
21:26           G^ViCE | couldn't they put a tube in to help him breathe for a while till the swelling went down?
21:26          AmyWolf | went to flash it
21:26          AmyWolf | and it said couldn't open it
21:26           tophyr | the 'pm' command doesn't seem to play nice with 5.0.7's Apps2SD implementation (unless i'm not doing it right) - any install attempts appear to fail with Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE]. anyone else noticed that?
21:26          AmyWolf | with (bad) in parentheses
21:27          twois10 | I did notice your bluetooth was running Juggie when you posted the services
21:27          DeuX-PT | G^ViCE was pointless, he would just suffer more
21:27          Loonacy | tophyr: Do you have Apps2SD enabled?
21:27           G^ViCE | yeah fair enough =(
21:27       mschoolbus | AmyWolf,  redownload the file
21:27          AmyWolf | yeah I am
21:27           Juggie | twois10, has anyone tried disabeling the app compability option to see if it helps?
21:27          AmyWolf | I had to do the same thing with the radio file, strangely o.O
21:27          DeuX-PT | anyway he lived 15 years
21:27          DeuX-PT | that's more then the average
21:27          Loonacy | tophyr: I had that problem because i hadn't enabled it in settings.
21:27           tophyr | Loonacy yeah, if i go in via Application Manager and move to internal then move back, the apps (that i'm fixing) work right
21:27          twois10 | Juggie: my battery is fine so I dont know
21:27       mschoolbus | AmyWolf, i have found transferring via sd adapter worked best for me
21:27           Juggie | hrmf.
21:28          AmyWolf | sd adapter?
21:28           Juggie | i guess i could move all my apps and then copy them back one at a time.
21:28          AmyWolf | like a cardslot?
21:28          DeuX-PT | now i have 5 cats and 5 dogs
21:28          DeuX-PT | :|
21:28          AmyWolf | Actually, hmm.  Does the g1 have a microsd or just sd?
21:28       mschoolbus | AmyWolf, yes - is that what you are doing?
21:28       mschoolbus | microsd
21:28          AmyWolf | ah
21:28          twois10 | as you know, I sleep just fine
21:28          AmyWolf | nope
21:28         *        DeuX-PT feels like those old ladys who have shitloads of cats
21:28          twois10 | perhaps am one of the luck ones
21:28          AmyWolf | I have a microsd adapter somewhere
21:28           Juggie | twois10, can you pastebin your installed apps?
21:28       sonicyooth | deux-pt: best thing you can do is make sure they get fixed.
21:29          AmyWolf | "E:Can't open /sdcard/spl-signed.zip" "(bad)" again
21:29          AmyWolf | :|
21:29       mschoolbus | AmyWolf, maybe try that if you can, i had issues with bad files like that before as well transferring over usb
21:29           Juggie | i'll cross reference it against what i have
21:29          AmyWolf | yeah
21:29           G^ViCE | holy crap
21:29           G^ViCE | 10 pets?
21:29              x03 | hi
21:29          AmyWolf | i'll have to look for that adaptor
21:29           G^ViCE | how much do they cost you in food?!
21:30          DeuX-PT | hum
21:30          DeuX-PT | idk, since they live with my parentd
21:30          DeuX-PT | parents*
21:30          DeuX-PT | they have a farm
21:30          AmyWolf | yeah i found it :D
21:30          AmyWolf | i think its a microsd D:
21:30       mschoolbus | \o/
21:30          DeuX-PT | with me on my apartment i just have a small cat now
21:30          AmyWolf | uh
21:30          AmyWolf | lol
21:30          DeuX-PT | small, with 4 years old
21:31           Juggie | twois10, it has to be something super common.
21:31          AmyWolf | how do i get the microsd card out of the phone D: i see it but lol
21:31          DeuX-PT | u push in and it comes out
21:31          DeuX-PT | at least on the magic is like that
21:31          AmyWolf | yeah got it
21:31          AmyWolf | had to ues a guitar pick to push it in, haha
21:31          twois10 | Juggie: http://pastebin.org/198772
21:32        thewizord | why does cyangon 5.0.6N1 seem pretty crapp on battery too?
21:32     clarkeismine | I was looking to get a higher class microsd card for my G1 so I could have faster USB transfers... any idea what the maximum transfer rate for the G1 usb controller is?
21:32     clarkeismine | like 15MB/s copying to the G1?
21:32           Juggie | twois10, this everything or only whats on sd?
21:32       mschoolbus | clarkeismine, i doubt that fast
21:33          DeuX-PT | clarkeismine class 10SD card can reach the max 10Mb/s
21:33          DeuX-PT | so no, not that fast
21:33          AmyWolf | ok
21:33          AmyWolf | so its not microsd
21:33          AmyWolf | my adaptor
21:33          AmyWolf | hmm
21:33       mschoolbus | mini sd? :/
21:33          twois10 | Juggie: http://pastebin.org/198775
21:33           Juggie | class 10 is only 10mb/s?
21:33          AmyWolf | no idea
21:33           Juggie | that seems low
21:33         *  francoissmexy test
21:33          AmyWolf | its bigger than microsd
21:33       mschoolbus | Juggie, that is fast..
21:33         *  francoissmexy thinks twitter has just finished exploding
21:33          DeuX-PT | no
21:34          DeuX-PT | class 10 is max 22Mb/s
21:34        piusvelte | is the sd class burst speed or max sustainable? i thought that it was the latter
21:34        grindking | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital#Speeds
21:34          DeuX-PT | but the average is 10Mb/s
21:34          Loonacy | Juggie: MB, not mb.
21:34       mschoolbus | piusvelte, should be sustainable speed, they burst higher
21:34          AmyWolf | is there a way I can verify that the file transferred properly
21:34          AmyWolf | without trying to flash it
21:35          Loonacy | AmyWolf: md5sum
21:35            vinic | check dem md5
21:35       mschoolbus | AmyWolf, i would just redownload and retransfer
21:35          DeuX-PT | yeah check the md5
21:35          AmyWolf | I did
21:35          AmyWolf | twice now
21:35           Juggie | thats write speed
21:35           Juggie | read should be faster
21:35       mschoolbus | or... you have another microsd card?
21:35       mschoolbus | could be a crappy card
21:35          AmyWolf | nope
21:35       mschoolbus | shucks
21:36          DeuX-PT | aight, straight to bed, watch avatar
21:36         -!- _google_ is now known as alex_k
21:36          DeuX-PT | laterz
21:36         -!- alex_k is now known as alex_k|bored
21:37      Obelixprime | I though compcache was enabled by default on cm5?
21:37      Obelixprime | thought*
21:37          twois10 | no
21:37          twois10 | you have to enable it via spare parts Obelixprime\
21:37      Obelixprime | gotcha, thanks
21:38     alex_k|bored | what does compcache do for me exactly?
21:38          Loonacy | alex_k|bored: It compresses a portion of your ram.
21:38      Obelixprime | Compcache (compressed caching) provides the ability to use part  of the RAM as compressed swap. In other words, you can take a portion of  your RAM (default 25%) and use it as swap, compressing the data before  moving it into swap, and decompressing it when moving it out of swap.  This is a classic time-space trade-off. You effectively get more memory,  but some of it is slower than normal RAM due to the C
21:38            bri3d | ^^
21:38     alex_k|bored | oh i seee. :p
21:39       sonicyooth | is there the same time-space tradeoff with regular swap?
21:39           G^ViCE | stargate!
21:39           G^ViCE | only during solar flares
21:39           G^ViCE | heh
21:39     alex_k|bored | i dont feel as though it is necessary for me.
21:39      Obelixprime | sonicyooth: if you don't have a class 6 sd card it could wear down your SD card pretty quickly
21:40          Loonacy | sonicyooth: It's a lot faster than regular swap because it's all in RAM.  It mostly just puts extra load on your CPU.
21:40       sonicyooth | gotcha.
21:41          twois10 | I use both compcache and disk swap
21:41          twois10 | no slow down here, am flying
21:42        piusvelte | twois10:compcache takes priority over disk swap, correct?
21:42          twois10 | available internal space = 46mb
21:42          twois10 | piusvelte: they can co exist
21:42          Loonacy | piusvelte: I think it depends on the order that you enable them.
21:43       sonicyooth | i need to dl something to use swap with cm 5 right?
21:43          twois10 | Compache has a feature to use disk swap, thats what am using
21:43        piusvelte | what i meant was that the compcache gets saturated before using disk as additional space
21:43          Loonacy | sonicyooth: No, you just need to partition your SD card, format the swap, then use a userinit.sh to swapon
21:43          twois10 | piusvelte: yes in a way
21:43          twois10 | the proper term is called compcache with backing swap
21:44       sonicyooth | loonacy: it's formatted - i'll have to figure out what that userinit.sh thing is.. still learning here :)
21:44        piusvelte | twois10:thank you!
21:44          AmyWolf | ok
21:44          AmyWolf | according to md5summer they should all be good now <.<
21:44         *        AmyWolf gogo try again
21:45          twois10 | With the latest compcache you can also use swap files
21:45          twois10 | this is for those who dont have a swap partition
21:46          AmyWolf | nope
21:46          AmyWolf | not working
21:46          AmyWolf | awesome
21:46          Loonacy | sonicyooth: It's a bit out of date, but you can look at http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/index.php/Userinit.sh
21:46        piusvelte | twois10:that's wild, a bit slower though, i'd imagine
21:46       sonicyooth | loonacy: excellent, many thanks
21:46          Loonacy | sonicyooth: In CM5, userinit.sh goes in /ext-sd/userinit.sh instead of /system/sd/userinit.sh
21:46          twois10 | disk is normally slower that RAM
21:46          twois10 | so yes
21:46          Loonacy | sonicyooth: Also, you don't need to put the compcache in your userinit, so just do the one that's swap only.
21:46          twois10 | but it is still faster than not having it
21:47          AmyWolf | any ideas why it keeps saying (bad) when i try to flash dangerspl
21:47          twois10 | because you are creating a cache of files in RAM with swap
21:47          twois10 | so apps load faster
21:47          AmyWolf | maybe I can try a different recovry console?
21:47          AmyWolf | dunno :<
21:48        piusvelte | twois10:sure is, but mounting a file as a swap filesystem, from say a ext fs, would seem slower than directly mounting a swap partition
21:48       sonicyooth | loonacy: and I'll need to do this each time I flash correct?
21:48          Loonacy | sonicyooth: No, it gets stored on your SD card.
21:48          twois10 | piusvelte: i dont see what the difference would be
21:48       sonicyooth | loonacy: oh even better. :) thanks again, gonna try it now
21:49          Loonacy | sonicyooth: Actually, after looking at it, you may want to disable compcache in settings and enable it in userinit.sh instead.
21:49        piusvelte | either way, it's from disk, but there's an extra layer to the swap file, but i've never compared performance
21:49       sonicyooth | loonacy: yeah, compcache is off in settings. I only have a swap partition I believe
21:49          twois10 | oh, yes, you have to disable compcache from spare parts to use it from the userinit script
21:51          twois10 | piusvelte:  i honestly dont see what the difference would be whether the swap is a partition or a file. Both work exactly the same way
21:51          twois10 | No extra layer
21:51          Loonacy | twois10: With a file you have the added layer of dealing with the filesystem.
21:53          AmyWolf | yeah I'll just install a different recovery console and try that
21:54          twois10 | I think you guys may be right due fact of the file system, but i doubt the performance would differ significantly piusvelte and Loonacy
21:54          Loonacy | twois10: Plus with a swap file you might get some fragmentation (although that's not really an issue on flash storage)
21:55       mschoolbus | AmyWolf, are you using clockwork?
21:55          AmyWolf | no
21:55       mschoolbus | maybe consider using that
21:56        piusvelte | twois10:i think you're right, that the difference is marginal, but i've exceeded my knowledge in this area. i love that the swap file is an option
21:57          AmyWolf | RA recovery giving me the same error, what the crap :<
21:59          AmyWolf | will try clockwork now and see if that helps? lol
22:00          twois10 | my current setting is 24 mb of compcache and 16 mb (or 32mb) used as backing swap
22:00          twois10 | **(out of 32 mb)**
22:01            A-Pap | Has anyone found the new boot.img or libhtc_ril.so that was posted??
22:01         -!- mschoolbus is now known as mschool|afk
22:02          AmyWolf | mschool|afk: same error
22:03        piusvelte | twois10:i'm not using compcache now, but have a 32mb swap partition. i'll try out compcache, but 5.0.7 is already fast, i can't imagine it faster
22:03     zombiereagan | twois10: on the swap file vs swap partition thing, if you're doing it on a journaled FS, then you have journal IO on top of the swap IO
22:03       mschoolbus | Amy did you try to redownload the file and retransfer to sd?
22:03          AmyWolf | 3 times now
22:03          AmyWolf | checked with md5 too
22:03       mschoolbus | Hmmm
22:03          AmyWolf | hmm
22:04         *        AmyWolf checks something
22:04       mschoolbus | You have no other way to get that file to sd?
22:04          AmyWolf | yeah the zip is definitely openable on my pc
22:04          AmyWolf | not really :<
22:04             jeh_ | do you have a mac?
22:04       mschoolbus | Try downloading directly from phone to sd?
22:04          AmyWolf | hmm
22:04          twois10 | zombiereagan: yes i am using ext4..some people prefer ext2, honestly there is no difference
22:05          AmyWolf | that might work
22:05          Loonacy | twois10: Except with ext2 you don't have a useless journal thrashing your sdcard.
22:05       mschoolbus | Give it a shot maybe
22:05          AmyWolf | yeah, might work
22:05       mschoolbus | Wish you had another sd and a pc reader as well
22:05          AmyWolf | yeah :<
22:05     zombiereagan | twois10: besides journaling, there's not much in ext4 thats of much use on these devices
22:06       mschoolbus | Get ready for potential extreme battery drain with cm5 on g1
22:06     zombiereagan | i dont know if extents really make much of a difference, since there aret that many files going to the ext4 fs anyways
22:06       mschoolbus | Its pretty bad.. desperately waiting for a fix
22:07          twois10 | zombiereagan: true
22:07          AmyWolf | <.<
22:07          Loonacy | zombiereagan: journaling is useless on sdcards, too.
22:07          AmyWolf | "cannot download" "the content beind downloaded is not supported on this phone"
22:07          AmyWolf | lol
22:07          AmyWolf | never really DL'ed anything with my phone like that, there something i have to do?
22:08       mschoolbus | I wonder if wget is on the phone
22:08     zombiereagan | Loonacy: its not useless, if you're doing a write and the power drops before its commited, its useful, but on a mobile device you probably arent doing that
22:08         -!- natediddy is now known as natediddy|afk
22:08        grindking | i just follow directions
22:08        grindking | the wiki says to use ext4
22:08          Loonacy | zombiereagan: If you're doing a write and the power drops before it's commited, then you've lost more than the journal keeps a record of.
22:09          Loonacy | zombiereagan: When you write a file on an SD card, it erases the ENTIRE sector, not just the part where the file is.  So if it gets interrupted, then the journal can't recover.
22:09       mschoolbus | Amy you can try using terminal, wget http://link_here
22:09     zombiereagan | grindking: i dont tink theres a good reason NOT to use ext4
22:09          AmyWolf | by that you mean telnet to my phone?
22:10     zombiereagan | Loonacy: yeah, i dont mess with heavy writes to SD cards too much
22:10       mschoolbus |  Cd /sdcard (all lowercase)
22:10          Loonacy | zombiereagan: So the journal is useless, and worse than that it thrashes your sd card.
22:10       mschoolbus | Then wget (link here)
22:10       mschoolbus | Yes phone telnet
22:10     zombiereagan | you can turn it off
22:10     zombiereagan | or just do data=writeback
22:10       mschoolbus | Or console/terminal whatever is called
22:11          AmyWolf | wget:not found
22:12          twois10 | The journaling on you sdcard for this device is not needed, you can even disable it
22:12       mschoolbus | Omg, wget isn't on cm4?
22:12          AmyWolf | I am in rc29
22:12       mschoolbus | Ohh
22:12          AmyWolf | due to accidentally flashing it over my cm4 XD
22:13       mschoolbus | In your case, you may have to upgrade to get that file over
22:13       mschoolbus | Sadly
22:13          AmyWolf | haha
22:13       mschoolbus | But maybe the usb transfer will just work then
22:13          AmyWolf | yeah i'll just pop CM4 back in
22:13          AmyWolf | and go from there
22:14       mschoolbus | Cool, hope that works!
22:14          twois10 | Loonacy: how many decades do you plan to use the sd card, i think the so called damage journaling does to the  sd card is exaggerated
22:15          AmyWolf | Once I have CM4 installed, can I flash dangerspl and then flash CM5 and gapps-ds-ERE36B?
22:15          AmyWolf | or should I wipe or whatever first
22:16           advil0 | you guys think i can swindle a t-mo rep into giving me a full upgrade discount if i bought my G1 in late november of 2008?
22:17          Loonacy | twois10: Exaggerated or no, it does damage your sd card and it doesn't offer any advantages, so why not do a quick tune2fs -O ^has_journal?
22:17        Cassetrop | AmyWolf I think you have to swipe.
22:17       mschoolbus | Amy, I would wipe first
22:18          AmyWolf | kk
22:18          AmyWolf | I can (attempt to) install dangerspl though right
22:19       mschoolbus | Yes, but have your cm5 files ready to flash immediately after danger, as you will have no os
22:19          AmyWolf | yeah I will
22:21          AmyWolf | jesus
22:21          AmyWolf | this is making me mad
22:21        QuinnLion | :D
22:21        QuinnLion | http://s203.photobucket.com/albums/aa279/Erik_Tategami/car/
22:21          AmyWolf | now i'm getting signature verification failed on the  drc83 defanged
22:21       mschoolbus | Geez :(
22:22              d_p | someone said in here if they removed their sd card it improved battery life/sleeping.   It's bullshit, that did nothing.  cell standby is taking up all the battery still
22:22              d_p | if youre trying to goto cm5 you dont need drc83
22:22       mschoolbus | Amy maybe pick up another microsd and adapter tomorrow? :p
22:22          AmyWolf | I'm trying to go up to CM4
22:22          AmyWolf | if i had money I would
22:22              d_p | what recovery are you using
22:23          AmyWolf | clockwork
22:23       mschoolbus | She tried all I think lol
22:23          AmyWolf | yeah
22:23              d_p | thats the problem
22:23              d_p | switch to amon ra 1.6.2
22:23          AmyWolf | I was JUST using amon ra
22:23          AmyWolf | and getting the same retarded errors
22:23          AmyWolf | i'm TRYING to go from RC29 to CM5
22:23          AmyWolf | but I get..sec
22:23              d_p | really?  well, i've seen a bunch of upgrade errors for people trying to flash from clockwork & they've said amon ra fixed it
22:23          AmyWolf | "e:can't open /sdcard/spl-signed.zip (bad)"
22:24       mschoolbus | She is having file corruption between pc and sd card
22:24              d_p | try re-downloading the danger spl but over 3g through your phone and not your home wireless router (if thats what you used to download it before)
22:24       mschoolbus | She has checked md5s as well
22:24          AmyWolf | yeah
22:25          AmyWolf | also i tried downloading via my phone
22:25          AmyWolf | but yeah
22:25          AmyWolf | "cannot download" "the content beind downloaded is not supported on this phone"
22:25       mschoolbus | What she suppose to use on rc29 to do that?
22:25              d_p | the web browser?
22:25       mschoolbus | Try installing opera browser?
22:25              d_p | long press & save the link
22:26          Loonacy | AmyWolf: I may have missed something, but if you just flashed RC29 you had better upgrade your radio before flashing DangerSPL.
22:26          AmyWolf | I did
22:26          Loonacy | Okay, just making sure.
22:26         *        AmyWolf nods
22:26          Loonacy | Don't want any bricks in here.
22:26         *        AmyWolf nods
22:26        grindking | wow goog bought bumptop
22:27     zombiereagan | never heard of it before
22:27          Loonacy | The last time i tried to buy bumptop i got busted by an undercover cop.
22:27          Loonacy | Or maybe that was something else.
22:27           teferi | okay, try this again, identified this time.
22:27           teferi | so, I saw on cyanogen's twitter that there's a partial fix for the dream/5.0.7 battery life problem?
22:28          Loonacy | teferi: http://n0rp.chemlab.org/android/testing
22:28           teferi | Loonacy: ah, cheers, couldn't find a link. thanks!
22:29           teferi | flash boot.img over the install and copy libhtc_ril.so over wherever it is now?
22:30              d_p |  /system/lib
22:30          Loonacy | teferi: Yeah, fastboot flash boot boot.img
22:30           teferi | yeah, my phone isn't showing up on usb and wants a reboot or i'd have found it myself
22:30           teferi | Loonacy: ah, it's a replacement SPL
22:30          Loonacy | teferi: No, it's a replacement boot.
22:30           teferi | ergh. yeah.
22:31          AmyWolf | ok there
22:31          AmyWolf | defanged is installing this time
22:31         *        AmyWolf recopied, checked md5 and all that
22:31         *         teferi reboots into fastboot to try it
22:31          Loonacy | AmyWolf: If you have a fastboot capable SPL you might get better luck flashing through fastboot.
22:32          AmyWolf | dont think I do
22:33          AmyWolf | so since I updated my radio.. defanged and Cm4 won't overwrite it right?
22:33              d_p | right, defanged doesnt have the radio.img
22:33     zombiereagan | so is google ever going to send out more invites to google voice?
22:33          AmyWolf | kk
22:35          Psylink | zombiereagan: they're selling them on ebay like everyone else ;)
22:35     zombiereagan | haha
22:36     zombiereagan | figures
22:36           teferi | Loonacy: got it flashed and the file copied over, will see tomorrow how much it helped :) thanks again!
22:37         -!- natediddy|afk is now known as natediddy
22:37         -!- EugeneKay is now known as EugeneKaway
22:37          Loonacy | teferi: It seems to have helped a lot for me, but it's not perfect.  I dropped from 80% to 50% in 7 hours.
22:37         thebruce | quit
22:38          Loonacy | Quitter.
22:38           teferi | good to hear
22:39           teferi | hopefully we'll be able to find a real fix soon, but, hey, it's the price I pay for being a sucker^Wbeta tester
22:39           teferi | no point in complaining about a problem I volunteered for.
22:39           teferi | at least it didn't eat my cat.
22:39     zombiereagan | ive been watching powertop with that patch
22:39     zombiereagan | gp_timer is much less chatty now
22:40           teferi | oh wow, I didn't even realize that that was in the image
22:40     zombiereagan | yep
22:40           teferi | very cool!
22:40     zombiereagan | ended up being pretty handy
22:40           teferi | it's a great tool
22:41           teferi | I didn't even know it'd been ported to ARM, though I guess it makes perfect sense
22:41         *        Psylink goes to watch iron man 2
22:41     zombiereagan | yeah, you've just gotta ignore the tips about HPET
22:41           teferi | gp_timer seems to be doing about 13.7 wakeups/s
22:41           teferi | out of a total of about 50
22:41     zombiereagan | teferi: it was in the 60s before
22:41           teferi | yow!
22:41     zombiereagan | for me
22:42           teferi | for just that one thread, or total?
22:42     zombiereagan | just for gp_timer
22:42     zombiereagan | it was going nuts
22:42     zombiereagan | i'll see if gallery3d makes it angry
22:44          twois10 | anyone notice you uses gallery and try to go back everything become distorted with lines ?
22:44     zombiereagan | i havent noticed it
22:44     zombiereagan | doesnt meant it didnt happen :\
22:44        TheGoshem | If im having issues with my N1 flopping from 3G to H like crazy, what's the best thing to try? Im Radio 4.03.00.21_2
22:45          twois10 | for example, if you load gallery then look at a picture, and then press back button to gallery home page, it screen becomes distorted with many lines
22:45           teferi | zombiereagan, Loonacy: anyway, thanks for the help. 'night.
22:45      canadiancow | TheGoshem: it will only show "H" when you're actively transferring data
